Perceptions of Racial Discrimination
and the Risk of Preterm Birth
Lynn Rosenberg,1 Julie R. Palmer,1 Lauren A. Wise,1
Nicholas J. Horton,2 and Michael J. Corwin3

Background. Because racial discrimination might contribute
to their excess of preterm births, we assessed experiences of
racism in relation to preterm birth among African-American
women.
Methods. We used data from the Black Women’s Health
Study, a follow-up study of African-American women begun in
1995. Data on subsequent singleton births were obtained using
follow-up questionnaires in 1997 and 1999; nine questions
about experiences of racism were asked in 1997. We compared
mothers of 422 babies born 3 or more weeks early (because of
premature labor for unknown reasons or rupture of mem-
branes) with mothers of 4544 babies of longer gestation. We
used generalized estimating equation models to estimate odds

confounders.
Results. The adjusted ORs for preterm birth were 1.3 (95%
confidence interval [CI] (cid:1) 1.1–1.6) for women who reported
unfair treatment on the job and 1.4 (1.0 –1.9) for women who
reported that people acted afraid of them at least once a week.
Overall ORs for the seven other racism questions were close to
1.0. Among 491 women with (cid:1)12 years of education, ORs
were 2.0 or greater for four racism variables.
Conclusions. These data provide some evidence for an in-
crease in preterm birth among women who report experiences
of racism, particularly women with lower levels of education.
(EPIDEMIOLOGY 2002;13:646 –652)

In the United States, preterm birth is the most im-

portant cause of perinatal mortality.1 Black babies
are more likely to be born preterm than white babies,
and known risk factors do not fully explain the differ-
ence.1 It has been suggested that experiences of racial
discrimination may contribute to the excess among Af-
rican-Americans.2– 6 Recently, Collins et al. provided
data on this possibility from a case-control study of 25
infants weighing less than 1500 gm and 60 infants
weighing more than 2500 gm born to low-income Afri-
can-American women.7 The unadjusted odds ratio (OR)

for the birth of a child weighing less than 1500 gm was
doubled for women who reported having experienced
racial discrimination, although the 95% confidence in-
terval (CI) included 1.0. We used data from the Black
Women’s Health Study (BWHS) to assess the relation
of perceptions of racial discrimination to premature
birth among U.S. black women.

Methods
The BWHS, a follow-up study of U.S. black women,
began in 1995 when 64,500 women age 21– 69 years
enrolled through postal health questionnaires.8 –10 The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards
of Boston University and Howard University. Partici-
pants indicated their informed consent by completing
the questionnaires. We mailed the questionnaires to
subscribers to Essence magazine, members of several pro-
fessional organizations, and friends and relatives of early
respondents. The women were from across the United
States, with the largest numbers from California, Geor-
gia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachu-
setts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina,
Virginia and the District of Columbia; 97% had com-
pleted high school. The women are followed biannually

RACISM AND PRETERM BIRTH 647

through postal questionnaires. Follow-up questionnaires
were completed in 1997 by 82% and in 1999 by 80% of
cohort members.

We inquired on the 1997 and 1999 follow-up ques-
tionnaires about singleton births that had occurred in
the previous 2 years, including the child’s birth weight.
We asked the women if they had been told the child was
born 3 or more weeks early; those who responded posi-
tively were asked how many weeks early and the reason
for the early birth: premature labor for no known reason,
rupture of membranes, or medically induced labor or
Caesarean section. We believe that “three or more weeks
early” generally means (cid:2)37 weeks of gestation. To check
this, we compared the distribution of birth weights of the
babies born 3 or more weeks early with national data for
African-American babies of (cid:2)37 weeks’ gestation11 and
found the distributions to be similar.

The 1997 questionnaire contained nine questions
regarding experiences of racial discrimination. Three
questions asked about unfair treatment (on the job, in
housing and by the police). Five questions asked about
the frequency in daily life of other people’s behavior
toward the BWHS participant (participant receiving
poorer service than other people in restaurants or stores;
people acting as if they think the participant is not
intelligent; people acting as if they are afraid of her; people
acting as if they think she is dishonest; and people acting as
if they are better than her). One question asked about how
often the participant thinks about her race.

The present analyses were confined to women who
completed the 1997 questionnaire, who reported on the
1997 or the 1999 questionnaire that they had a singleton
birth in the previous two years, and who were less than
45 years of age at the time of the birth. There were 5387
singleton births reported, of which 843 (15.6%) were
three or more weeks early (“preterm”). We excluded 421
preterm births that resulted from medically indicated
induction of labor or Caesarean section. Among the
remaining 4966 births there were 422 preterm births;
2583 of the births were reported on the 1997 question-
naire and 2283 births on the 1999 questionnaire. There
were 610 births to women who reported a birth on both
the 1997 and 1999 questionnaires. We compared the
mothers of the 422 preterm babies with mothers of 4544
babies born at longer gestations (“full term”).

We estimated ORs of preterm birth using generalized
estimating equation models12 that account for correlated
observations within subjects (that is, for more than one
birth from the same participant). We used PROC GEN-
MOD with the “logit link” function in SAS to estimate
regression parameters and 95% confidence intervals rep-
resenting the log odds ratio for risk of preterm birth in
relation to variables of interest (SAS version 8.2). An
exchangeable working correlation structure was as-
sumed, and the empirical variance estimator was utilized

to account for the repeated measures. We considered the
racial discrimination variables one at a time. In the
overall analyses, multivariate models adjusted for age at
delivery, years of education completed, marital status,
parity status before the present birth, previous preterm
birth, the mother herself having been born 3 or more
weeks early, smoking during the pregnancy, and whether
the birth was reported on the 1997 questionnaire. We
also ran models without previous preterm birth as a
covariate because of the potential of over-controlling for
underlying factors that influence more than one birth to
the same woman. The following additional variables
were assessed and found not to materially influence the
odds ratios: alcohol consumption, having a second job,
asthma, douching, high blood pressure or diabetes during
the pregnancy, body mass index before the pregnancy,
and geographic area of residence. Because 96% of the
women reported prenatal care during the first trimester,
we did not control for the use of prenatal care. Women
with missing information for a variable, with the excep-
tion of the variables that measured perceived racism,
were dropped from the analyses. The missing values for
the racism variables were of interest in themselves and
we therefore included indicator terms for them. ORs are
not given if the number of “exposed” preterm or full-
term births was less than four.

In addition to the analyses of the total sample, we
assessed racism in relation to preterm birth within strata
of education. Collins et al.7 found an association of
racism with low birth weight among low-income
women. We used years of education as a surrogate for
income.

Results
As shown in Table 1, mothers of preterm babies more
often had had a previous preterm baby or had been born
preterm themselves compared with mothers of full-term
babies. They also had lower educational attainment than
mothers of full-term babies, and more often smoked
during the pregnancy or were single. The mothers of
preterm and full-term babies were similar in age and
parity status.

Unfair treatment on the job was reported by over half
of the mothers, and from a quarter to a third reported
unfair treatment in housing or by police (Table 2). The
most frequent prejudicial behavior of other people to-
ward the BWHS participant, reported by about a quarter
of the women, was people acting as if they were better
than the subject (at least once a week).

The adjusted OR for unfair treatment on the job was
1.3 (CI (cid:1) 1.1–1.6); the estimates for unfair treatment in
housing or by police were smaller (Table 2). The OR did
not vary according to whether there were one, two or
three positive responses to the questions about unfair

Because some women may have in-
correctly reported how early their ba-
bies were born, we performed a sensi-
tivity analysis which included as cases
only 174 babies that were reported to
have been born 5 or more weeks early
(data not shown). The adjusted OR
was 1.4 (CI (cid:1) 1.0 –2.0) for unfair
treatment on the job, and 1.5 (0.9 –2.5) for people
acting afraid at least once at week. Within strata of
education (cid:1)12, 13–15 and (cid:2)16, there were 16, 69 and
87 babies, respectively, born 5 or more weeks early.
Among women with no more than 12 years of educa-
tion, the unadjusted OR was 1.6 (CI (cid:1) 0.5– 4.8) for
unfair treatment in housing and 4.3 (1.3–15) for poorer
service at least once a week. Among women with 13–15
years of education, the OR for people acting as if the
BWHS participant was dishonest at least once a week
was 2.0 (CI (cid:1) 1.0 – 4.2). Among women with 16 or more
years of education, the OR for unfair treatment on the
job was 1.8 (1.0 –3.0).

In an analysis analogous to that of Collins et al.,7 we
compared 85 very low birth weight ((cid:2)1500 gm) infants
to 4597 infants weighing 2500 gm or more. The unad-
justed ORs were 1.4 (CI (cid:1) 0.8 –2.2) for unfair treatment
on the job, 1.4 (0.6 –3.3) for people acting afraid at least
once a month, and 1.2 (0.6 –2.6) for people acting afraid
at least once a week.

Discussion
It has long been suspected that stress could influence
parturition, possibly through effects on the pituitary-
adrenal axis.13–19 For example, stress influences the pro-

treatment (data not shown). Adjusted ORs for the oc-
currence of the various behaviors at least once a week
were close to 1.0; the largest estimate was 1.4 (CI (cid:1)
1.0 –1.9) for people acting afraid. The OR did not vary
according to the total number of positive responses to the
behavior questions (data not shown). ORs for how often
the women think about their race were close to 1.0.

The proportion of women with missing values for the
racism questions ranged from 0.9% to 4.0% among the
women with preterm babies and 0.8% to 3.3% among
women with full-term babies (Table 2). The adjusted ORs
for the missing value category exceeded 1.0 for seven of the
nine racism questions and exceeded 2.0 for two.

We repeated the analyses reported in Table 2 without
control for previous preterm birth and found similar
results. In addition, the indicator term for the question-
naire on which the birth was reported did not influence
the odds ratio estimates. We also found no evidence for
an interaction of any of the racism variables with the
questionnaire on which the birth data were reported.

Table 3 presents unadjusted ORs from analyses strat-
ified according to level of educational attainment. Small
numbers made it difficult to run multivariate models;
furthermore, the unadjusted and adjusted ORs were sim-
ilar in the overall analyses. Among women with no more
than 12 years of education, the OR was 2.4 (CI (cid:1) 1.2-

duction of corticotrophin-releasing hormone, which
may influence the initiation of labor.18 Experiences of
racism may act as acute or chronic stressors.20 –23 Appre-
ciable proportions of BWHS participants reported per-
ceived experiences of racism. However, the present re-
sults on the relation of racism to preterm birth are
equivocal. The adjusted OR for preterm birth was 1.3
(CI (cid:1) 1.1–1.6) for women who reported unfair treat-
ment on the job and 1.4 (1.0 –1.9) for women who
reported that people acted afraid of them at least once a
week. However, the overall ORs were close to 1.0 for the
other racism questions, and there was no evidence of a
greater risk for women who gave positive responses to
more than one question.

Several associations of perceived experiences of rac-
ism with preterm birth appeared stronger among women

with no more than 12 years of education. Unadjusted
ORs were 2.0 or greater for unfair treatment in housing,
receiving poorer service at least once a week, people
acting as if the woman was not intelligent at least once
a week, and people acting afraid at least once a week.
Among the other strata of education, the OR was ele-
vated for unfair treatment on the job among women
with 16 or more years of education and for people acting
as if the subject was dishonest at least once a week
among women with 13–15 years of education. Many
comparisons were made and it will take further studies to
determine whether these findings represent real associ-
ations or chance findings.

Our analysis of very low birth weight yielded overall
ORs similar in magnitude to the estimates for preterm
birth overall for women who reported unfair treatment

RACISM AND PRETERM BIRTH 651

on the job and that others acted afraid, but the confi-
dence intervals were wide. There were too few very

education.

to stratify by

infants

Only a small proportion of women who responded to
the 1997 questionnaire failed to complete the questions
on racism. We thought a priori that women who chose
not to answer might be more sensitive to questions about
racism than women who did respond. The fact that most
of the ORs for preterm birth for women with missing
values were greater than 1.0 suggests that this was indeed
the case. Given the small number of women with miss-
ing values and the positive association of this category
for most of the racism questions with preterm birth, the
failure of some women to answer the racism questions
cannot explain the positive associations observed be-
tween perceptions of racism and preterm birth among
women who did answer the questions.

We think it unlikely that participation in the BWHS
was contingent on women’s perceptions of racism or
propensity to give birth prematurely, particularly be-
cause questions on these factors were not included on
the questionnaire used at entry. Most of the data on risk
factors for preterm birth were collected before the oc-
currence of the births, thereby reducing concerns about
information bias and about the timing of the factors with
respect to the birth. The data on racism elicited by the
1997 questionnaire were collected prospectively in rela-
tion to births reported on the 1999 questionnaire, but
they were cross-sectional with respect to the reporting of
the 1997 births. An indicator term included in the
logistic regression for the questionnaire on which the
birth was reported did not influence the results. In
addition, we found no evidence of an interaction of the
racism variables with the questionnaire date.

A strength of the study is that the preterm birth group
was limited to births that occurred spontaneously and
did not include the heterogeneous group of preterm
births induced or delivered by Caesarean section for
medical reasons. Many previous studies assessed preterm
births without regard to the reason that the birth was
premature, with resultant confounding from factors re-
lated to having an early delivery for medical reasons.1

A limitation is that the BWHS data on births were
based on self-report. However, the birth weights of the
preterm group closely resembled those in national data
on births of (cid:2)37 weeks’ gestation.11 The fact that estab-
lished and suspected risk factors, such as previous pre-
term birth, cigarette smoking during pregnancy and sin-
gle marital status, were associated with preterm birth
also provides support for the validity of the data.1 In
addition, an analysis of babies reported to have been
born 5 or more weeks early yielded results similar to
those from the analyses of all preterm births.

The participants in the BWHS are better educated
than African-American women nationally.24 Whereas
about 15% of U.S. black women have not completed
high school, this was the case for only 3% of BWHS
participants. Thus, the BWHS is not informative on the
relation of racism to preterm birth among women with
less than 12 years of education.

The study by Collins and colleagues,7 the first to
provide direct evidence on the relation of racism to low
birth weight, included only low-income women without
private medical insurance. In contrast, almost all BWHS
participants have medical insurance; information on in-
come is unavailable, but almost all have completed high
school and about half have completed college. Because
of small numbers, we could not assess perceived racism
in relation to preterm birth among the BWHS partici-
pants most comparable with those in the study of Collins
et al.,
ie, women who had not graduated from high
school. However, we found stronger associations of some
of the racism variables with preterm birth among women
with no more than 12 years of education (most of whom
had completed 12 years). One can speculate that poorer
women might be more vulnerable to these experiences
than women with more resources.

The excess of preterm births among black women
compared with white women persists at the highest
educational levels.1 In the BWHS, unfair treatment on
the job was associated with preterm birth among women
with 16 or more years of education. If not attributable to
chance, this finding may reflect the susceptibility of
even the most educated black women to this type of
discrimination.

Although the questions on racism used by Collins et
al.7 and in the present study covered some of the same
domains (housing, work and service), the Collins ques-
tions
referred specifically to the index pregnancy
whereas the BWHS questions were about life experi-
ence. The questions in the study of Collins et al. had
been used previously in a nonpregnant population. The
BWHS questions about unfair treatment and behaviors
by others were taken from a larger set of questions
developed by Williams et al.25 and administered to black
and white populations. Responses to these questions
have been associated with general health perceptions,
mental health and depression. The question about how
often a participant thinks about her race, developed by
Jones,26 was strongly correlated with positive responses
among BWHS participants to the Williams questions.
This question has not been assessed previously in rela-
tion to health outcomes. The field is new and research is
needed to develop questions that are good measures of
stress related to experiences of racism.

The ability of individuals to cope with experiences of
racism could modify an effect of racism on health out-
comes. We did not collect information on the reactions

of BWHS participants to experiences of racism. Collins
et al.7 asked the women in their study about their reac-
tions, and they found both the reported experience of
racism and “internalization” of the response to it (by
accepting it as a fact of life or not talking about it) to be
associated with low birth weight.7

It might be suggested that genetic factors rather than
racism contribute to the black/white differences in rates
of preterm birth or low birth weight.2 Evidence against
this possibility comes from a study by David and Collins3
on the birth weights of infants of U.S.-born blacks,
African-born blacks, and U.S.-born whites in Illinois
during 1980 –1995. The mean birth weight of U.S.-born
black infants was lower than that of U.S.-born white
infants, and the proportion with low birth weight was
greater among black infants born in the United States.
The corresponding values for African-born black infants
were closer to those of U.S.-born white infants than to
those of U.S.-born black infants.

In conclusion, the BWHS adds mixed results to the
sparse body of data bearing on whether African-Amer-
icans’ experiences of racism affect preterm birth. Some
perceived experiences of racism among BWHS partici-
pants were associated with an increased rate overall, and
based on small numbers it appeared that an effect might
be stronger among women with lower levels of educa-
tion. However, other results suggested no association. In
view of the high rates of preterm birth among African-
American women and the possibility that racism may be
a contributor, further assessment of this issue is of great
importance.

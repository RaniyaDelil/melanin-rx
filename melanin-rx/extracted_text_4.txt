Abstract

Background: Pronounced racial disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes persist in the 
United States. Using an ecosocial and intersectionality framework and biopsychosocial model of 
health, we aimed to understand Black pregnant women’s experiences of gendered racism during 
pregnancy.

Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 Black pregnant women in New 
Haven, Connecticut. We asked women about their experience of being pregnant, experiences of 
gendered racism, and concerns related to pregnancy and parenting Black children. Transcripts 
were coded by three trained analysts using grounded theory techniques.

Results: Women experienced gendered racism during pregnancy—racialized pregnancy stigma
—in the form of stereotypes stigmatizing Black motherhood that devalued Black pregnancies. 
Women reported encountering assumptions that they had low incomes, were single, and had 
multiple children, regardless of socioeconomic status, marital status, or parity. Women 
encountered racialized pregnancy stigma in everyday, healthcare, social services, and housing-

related contexts, making it difficult to complete tasks without scrutiny. For many, racialized 
pregnancy stigma was a source of stress. To counteract these stereotypes, women used a variety of 
coping responses, including positive self-definition.

Discussion: Racialized pregnancy stigma may contribute to poorer maternal and infant 
outcomes by way of reduced access to quality healthcare; impediments to services, resources, and 
social support; and poorer psychological health. Interventions to address racialized pregnancy 
stigma and its adverse consequences include anti-bias training for healthcare and social service 
providers; screening for racialized pregnancy stigma and providing evidence-based coping 
strategies; creating pregnancy support groups; and developing a broader societal discourse that 
values Black women and their pregnancies.

INTRODUCTION

Contrary to global trends, rates of poor maternal and infant outcomes have increased in the 
US. Between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio (maternal deaths/100,000 live 
births) increased from 16.9 to 26.4 (GBD 2015 Maternal Mortality Collaborators, 2016). In 
recent years, rates of preterm birth (<37 completed weeks of gestation) and low birth weight 
(<2,500 grams) have also increased (Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Driscoll, & Drake, 
2018b). Of particular concern, racial disparities in poor birth outcomes have recently 
widened (Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Driscoll, & Mathews, 2017; Martin, Hamilton, 
Osterman, Driscoll, & Drake, 2018a; Martin et al., 2018b; Xu, Murphy, Kochanek, Bastian, 
& Arias, 2018). Black women account for more than one-third of pregnancy-related deaths 
and have 3.2 times the risk of dying from pregnancy complications of White women 
(Creanga et al., 2015). Black infants have 2.5 times the infant mortality rate (deaths in the 
first year of life/1,000 live births) (Xu et al., 2018), 1.5 times the preterm birth rate, and two 
times the low birth weight rate of White infants (Martin et al., 2018b). Neither maternal 
factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), health behaviors, and prenatal care (Braveman 
et al., 2015; Goldenberg et al., 1996; Mohlman & Levy, 2016) nor macrosocial determinants 
of health disproportionately affecting marginalized populations, such as neighborhood 
poverty and unemployment (Morenoff, 2003; O'Campo, Xue, Wang, & Caughy, 1997; Pearl, 
Braveman, & Abrams, 2001), completely explain these disparities.

Research suggests the lived experiences of Black women in the US, in particular racism 
(Dominguez, 2011; Dominguez, Dunkel-Schetter, Glynn, Hobel, & Sandman, 2008) and 
cumulative stress from racism over the life course (Lu & Halfon, 2003), are determinants of 
racial disparities in adverse birth outcomes. For example, risk of poorer birth outcomes is 
higher among US-born Black women than foreign-born Black women (Cabral, Fried, 
Levenson, Amaro, & Zuckerman, 1990; J. W. Collins, Jr., Soskolne, Rankin, & Bennett, 
2013; David & Collins, 1997; Howard, Marshall, Kaufman, & Savitz, 2006; Oliver et al., 
2018), and infant birth weight of descendants of foreign-born Black women approaches that 
of US-born Black women (J. W. Collins, Jr., Wu, & David, 2002).

Rosenthal and Lobel contend that Black women are subject to a uniquely stressful 
experience in the US due to intersecting stigmatized and marginalized identities—woman 
and Black—and that stigmatization and marginalization of these identities increase Black

women’s risk of poor birth outcomes (Rosenthal & Lobel, 2011). The combination of 
sexism and racism is referred to as “gendered racism” (Essed, 1991), and theoretical 
frameworks of intersectionality describe how this intersectional experience of both forms of 
oppression is greater than their sum (Crenshaw, 1989). Intersectionality is a core tenet of the 
reproductive justice movement (Sister Song, n.d.), a framework developed by women of 
color that combines reproductive rights and social justice issues (e.g., economic injustice, 
welfare reform, housing, and environmental justice) to address intersecting oppressions 
(Price, 2010; Ross & Solinger, 2017). The framework focuses on the “lived, embodied 
reproductive and whole-life experiences within their communities of people who can 
become pregnant and give birth” (Ross & Solinger, 2017, page 12). We draw on the 
reproductive justice framework to situate women’s experiences within a larger context that 
acknowledges how oppressive systems deny personhood to women based on their 
intersecting identities.

In the literature, gendered racism is operationalized as gendered racial microaggressions 
(Lewis, Williams, Peppers, & Gadson, 2017), events (Thomas, Witherspoon, & Speight, 
2008), or stereotypes (P. H. Collins, 2000; Jerald, Cole, Ward, & Avery, 2017; Rosenthal & 
Lobel, 2018). Stereotypic perceptions of Black women combining sexist, racist, and classist 
images such as mammies (faithful, domestically servile), matriarchs (aggressive, 
unfeminine), welfare mothers (low-income, unwed), and Jezebels (sexually aggressive) (P. 
H. Collins, 2000) to stigmatize Black motherhood in particular, casting in a negative light 
not only gender and racial identity but also sexual identity. Negative stereotypic images of 
Black women in the US extend throughout history to justify economic exploitation and 
control of Black women’s sexuality and fertility (P. H. Collins, 2000). Moreover, these 
stereotypes reflect and reinforce the concept of stratified reproduction, whereby 
reproduction is differentially experienced and valued across social hierarchies (Colen, 1995).

Theoretical pathways between gendered racism and poor birth outcomes are built upon 
Clark et al.’s biopsychosocial model of racism (Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999) 
and Lazarus and Folkman’s stress and coping framework (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). 
Racism is a perceived stressor that, depending on coping responses, results in negative 
psychological and physiological stress responses, and subsequently poor health outcomes 
(Clark et al., 1999). Sociodemographic, psychological, and behavioral factors moderate this 
pathway (Clark et al., 1999).

Empirical research on coping among Black women indicates that racism-specific coping 
responses include active and passive emotional and behavioral responses (McNeilly et al., 
1996; Vines et al., 2001). Active responses include feeling angry, anxious, and sad 
(emotional) and working harder to prove others wrong and praying (behavioral). Passive 
responses include feeling powerless and hopeless (emotional) and ignoring, accepting, and 
not speaking up (behavioral) (Vines et al., 2001). In general, active coping responses may be 
more effective than passive or emotion-focused coping responses for decreasing the 
association between racism and health (Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009). Among Black 
women, education but not income is associated with higher perceived racism, although there 
are few differences in coping responses by SES (Vines et al., 2006). Generally, 
psychological factors such as racial identity centrality may either buffer or exacerbate the

racism-mental health association, whereas social support is more likely to buffer this 
association (Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009).

The same mediators and moderators of the biopsychosocial model of racism may apply to a 
model of gendered racism. Africentric (Greer, 2007) and africultural (Utsey, Adams, & 
Bolden, 2000) frameworks of coping responses have been used to explore whether coping 
mediates the association between gendered racism and physical and mental health (Lewis et 
al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2008). In particular, the Africentric framework of coping responses 
includes four types of responses: interconnectedness, spirituality, problem-oriented coping, 
and disengagement (Greer, 2007). Recent empirical studies show gendered racism is directly 
associated with psychological distress (Lewis & Neville, 2015; Lewis et al., 2017; Thomas 
et al., 2008). This association is mediated by passive behavioral coping responses such as 
disengagement (Lewis et al., 2017) and avoidance (Lewis et al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2008), 
and moderated by lower levels of gendered racial identity centrality (Lewis et al., 2017).

Given large and widening racial disparities in maternal and infant outcomes—not fully 
accounted for by risk factors identified in existing research—we sought to examine the ways 
gendered racism manifests in the everyday experiences of pregnant Black women and may 
contribute to poorer maternal and infant outcomes. While racism contributes to the 
deterioration of the health of Black women across the life course to affect pregnancy 
outcomes (Geronimus, 1992), distinct forms of gendered racism may also manifest during 
pregnancy, potentially having a larger impact on pregnancy outcomes. Using an ecosocial 
framing of discrimination as an oppressive phenomenon operating at multiple levels across 
the life course (Krieger, 2012), an intersectionality framework, and a biopsychosocial model 
of gendered racism and health, this paper examines the gendered pregnancy racism that 
women experience and the implications of these experiences for maternal and infant health.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study site and sample

Our study was conducted in New Haven, Connecticut. New Haven is the second largest city 
in the state, with a population of 130,884 (United States Census Bureau, 2017). The city has 
a racially and ethnically diverse population of which 31.5% is Black non-Hispanic, 30.4% is 
Hispanic, and 30.3% is White non-Hispanic (United States Census Bureau, 2017). Overall 
levels of unemployment (10.4% compared to 6.6% nationally) and poverty (25.6% 
compared to 14.6% nationally) are high (United States Census Bureau, 2017).

Pregnant women who were at least 18 years of age and self-identified as African American 
or Black (herein collectively referred to as Black) were eligible to participate. Within this 
eligibility, we diversified our sample to include both women whose primary source of 
financial support was public assistance benefits and those supported by employment (i.e., the 
participant, their partner, or a family member was employed). Because experiences of racism 
may vary across socioeconomic groups (Ertel et al., 2012; Paradies, 2006), this allowed us to 
examine the intersection of race, gender, and SES. Women were recruited via flyers in 
healthcare settings; public (i.e., libraries, churches) and private (i.e., grocery stores,

groups (January 2017 to August 2018).

We provided participants with information on risks and benefits of the study and obtained 
verbal consent. We conducted individual, in-person, semi-structured interviews using an 
interview guide developed by the authors. We iteratively developed interview questions 
guided by ecosocial and intersectionality frameworks (see Table 1). Questions explored 
women’s perceptions of things that either helped or hindered their ability to have a healthy 
pregnancy; experiences of interpersonal and structural racism; experiences of living in their 
neighborhood; neighborhood attributes that helped them to have a healthy pregnancy or 
make healthy decisions about their pregnancy; and concerns related to pregnancy and 
parenting Black children. A trained interviewer (RM) conducted the interviews, which were 
approximately 45-60 minutes in length. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
Ethical approval was received from the Yale University Institutional Review Boards (Human 
Subjects Committee).

Three authors (RM, LB, and DK) trained and experienced in qualitative research methods 
followed an iterative and inductive coding approach adapted from grounded theory (Corbin 
& Strauss, 1998). We established coding reliability by iteratively selecting small samples of 
interviews to open code and double code to create and revise our code book. Coders met 
throughout the coding process and coding issues were resolved through consensus, assuring 
agreement on themes derived from the data and interview guide. The first author applied the 
final codebook to all transcripts using ATLAS.ti software (Version 8, Scientific Software 
Development GmhH, Germany, 2018). The authors used an abductive approach—a recursive 
and iterative process of fitting data and theories (Timmermans & Tavory, 2012)—to interpret 
data through the lens of intersectionality and the biopsychosocial model of gendered racism. 
To monitor biases, as backgrounds of the authors were different to those of Black pregnant 
women, we used field notes during data collection and memoing during data analysis. 
Additionally, we discussed our biases and various perspectives, and how to be sensitive and 
fair during author meetings. In completing the analysis presented here, the first author 
reviewed excerpts linked to relevant codes and read full transcripts to contextualize excerpts 
within participants’ broader narratives.

Description of researchers’ backgrounds

RM, a White and Asian female doctoral candidate, conducted the interviews. Three female 
authors (RM, LB, and DK) coded the data. LB is a White research scientist and DK is a 
White faculty member. Other members of the research team are White and included two 
faculty members (one female and one male) in the social and behavioral sciences department 
of a public health school, and one female maternal-fetal medicine specialist.

Findings

Twenty-four women ranging in age from 21 to 45 years (median 32 years) participated in the 
study (Table 2). Ten women (42%) received public assistance benefits as their primary 
source of financial support and 14 women (58%) were pregnant for the first time.

Participants in the study experienced gendered racism during pregnancy—a distinct form of 
intersectional stigma with potentially significant implications for women and their infants, 
that we hereafter refer to as racialized pregnancy stigma—in the form of stereotypes that 
stigmatized Black motherhood. Participants reported encountering judgments and negative 
assumptions in a multitude of contexts, including in their day-to-day lives, as well as in 
healthcare, social services, and housing-related contexts. Such racialized pregnancy stigma 
influenced their access to and quality of services and contributed to stress. Conversely, 
participants described individual coping responses and familial and community attributes 
that countered racialized pregnancy stigma.

Overall, an overarching sentiment Black pregnant women expressed was that they and their 
pregnancies were devalued by society. Participants felt judged based on negative 
assumptions about Black pregnant women, and for some, this judgment was a significant 
source of stress. Participant 11 succinctly captured this lived reality, “I do think pregnancy is 
harder for Black, African-American women, I really do. We get the most judgment… I 
notice that there be a lot more Black women stressed during their pregnancy, that I have 
witnessed.”

Racialized pregnancy stigma in everyday contexts

Participants experienced harmful assumptions about Black pregnant women in multiple 
everyday contexts, which made it difficult to complete routine tasks without scrutiny. 
Regardless of SES, participants encountered the assumption that Black pregnant women had 
low incomes and the attendant implication that they were dependent on government 
resources. Participant 11, whose husband was employed, described an intrusive encounter in 
a grocery store, where, despite her economic means, she was assumed to have a low income 
and be in receipt of public assistance benefits. In response, she felt compelled to dispel these 
assumptions and defend the public assistance deservingness of Black women:

[A Black woman] was like, “It’s a shame that they can just have kids and, oh, live 
free.” I turned around and was like, “Is there somethin’ you want to say to me?” 
“No, I’m just, all these young Black girls have all these kids and get everything 
free.” I said, “What do we get free?” I said, “Some people might get free medical, 
but there’s a lot of Caucasians and White people on the state.” I said, “If that’s what 
you’re talking about, and I’m not even paying with my groceries with food stamps. 
I’m with cash.” And she was like, “Oh, I apologize. It’s just, you know, some 
girls.”

Participants also encountered the assumption that Black pregnant women were single 
mothers, in conjunction with the assumption that this parenting structure was not conducive 
to providing a good home. For Participant 18, a single mother-to-be, encountering this 
assumption not only caused distress, but also hindered her enjoyment of her pregnancy: “I 
feel like it’s not fun … I could have the best life at home, and I could just be walking down 
the street pregnant and somebody will think that I'm alone and I don't have anybody because 
of what they know about African-American women. I don't like that at all. That’s just 
horrible. People can't think positive about you because what they already go off of.” Not 
only was this participant not seen for who she was, but these assumptions prevented her 
from being respected and celebrated as an expectant mother.

Participants also encountered the assumption that Black pregnant women have multiple 
children and perceived that large Black families were judged more harshly than large non-
Black families. As Participant 11 recounted, “I witnessed it a lot of times at the doctor’s 
office, at WIC, downtown, anywhere, in the restaurant, grocery store. I’m like, soon as a 
Black girl come in pregnant, even if she got one kid, the looks you get, the mumbling under 
your breath. It’s just, I honestly don’t think it’s right. People are too judgmental.”

Some women who did not fit the assumption of hyperfertility—that is, older, childless Black 
women—encountered assumptions that they were lying or hiding children from others. As 
Participant 20, who was childless at the age of 34, articulated, “I have been questioned as to, 
you know, why would I hide how many kids I have. Like, I'm not, I don't have any, like that 
isn’t actually a fact. I would tell you had I birthed someone and at this point I have not.” 
This assumption seeks to invalidate women’s lives and experiences and imposes judgement 
on women's characters whether or not they have children. Moreover, racist assumptions 
about reproduction may have potentially significant implications for Black women’s well-
being and pregnancy outcomes, even for women who do not fit the assumptions.

Racialized pregnancy stigma and obtaining healthcare

Participants described how negative assumptions about Black pregnant women influenced 
access to and quality of healthcare and shaped their relationships with healthcare providers. 
Participant 22, who worked in the healthcare field, described the distress of being ignored at 
a pediatric clinic when she sought a pediatrician for her baby-to-be and storming out of the 
clinic after not getting the care she sought:

I went to look for a doctor for a baby, for a pediatrician, and so I go in the office … 
I see that their backs are turned, okay, fine, whatever. I don’t know if I’m supposed 
to say hello, whatever. But this one lady, and she was White, she looked at me and 
then just walked away … I sat there for 10 minutes and no one acknowledged me. 
But when this other two [White] people come in and in the corner window the lady 
turn around and spoke to them. I’ve been sitting here for 10 minutes and you people 
didn’t say anything to me. And I, I just got up and stormed out. I said, “You know 
what? My baby won’t come here.”

Participant 11 conveyed how she felt judged when her healthcare provider recommended 
that she undergo a tubal ligation: “One of the midwives, it was basically they try to talk you 
into getting your tubes tied. ‘Oh, this is your third child’. That’s got nothin’ to do with it.”

The midwife’s implication that three children were enough and that the participant should 
use a permanent form of contraception to control her fertility devalues Black pregnancies 
and Black infants and denies Black women reproductive autonomy. Furthermore, the 
participant remarked that encountering such judgments made it difficult for her to have a 
healthy pregnancy.

Conversely, some participants reported building supportive relationships with healthcare 
providers who were “non-judgmental”. Overall, participants reported complex medical and 
social histories that included mental health conditions and substance use. These issues can 
be difficult to discuss but are important for healthcare providers to be aware of, which is why 
having supportive relationships with healthcare providers is so important. Participant 4, who 
received public assistance benefits, expressed how having non-judgmental healthcare 
providers made her feel more comfortable in opening up and sharing important health 
information:

My healthcare provider makes me feel comfortable. I have a male and a female. 
They answer all questions that I have, they’re very patient with me, very 
understanding. They’re non-judgmental and it helps me pursue a stronger 
relationship with them … Like, the questions that they ask me that I was concerned 
about, I was comfortable with telling the truth without feeling ashamed.

Racialized pregnancy stigma and obtaining services and resources

Participants described how assumptions about Black pregnant women negatively affected 
their access to resources intended to support healthy pregnancies. Several participants 
perceived social service providers to be judgmental and unwelcoming based on their 
attitudes and lines of questioning. Participant 17, who was financially supported by her 
partner but was unable to find employment while pregnant, described her interaction: “But 
[social services staff] stereotype you too, like basically, ‘Why are you not married yet? Are 
you still with the father? What are you gonna do with another child?’” Interactions such as 
these made women feel as if they were required to justify their reproductive choices and 
prove they were worthy of services they are entitled to by law. Furthermore, women were 
burdened with refuting the assumptions they encountered in this setting and proving 
themselves as having the credentials to be treated with respect. Participant 13 described how 
her interaction with social services staff improved after she revealed her level of education: 
“And when I told her I have a four-year degree, that’s when, kind of, like her body language 
and tone changed.”

Participant 17 questioned whether difficulties in finding a new apartment were related to 
being Black and pregnant: “He told me he rented out the apartment. I’m like, how did you 
rent it out that fast? So, I figured, I guess, I don’t know, maybe because I was pregnant or 
both … I’m African American, I don’t know.” Difficulties finding housing for growing 
families was reported as a stressor, particularly for women receiving public assistance 
benefits. Moreover, we found that women receiving public assistance benefits were highly 
residentially mobile, which may have exposed them to more experiences of housing 
discrimination, further impacting stress and pregnancy outcomes.

Participants also noted challenges in obtaining social support in their surroundings and 
reported that a lack of this type of support was a source of psychological stress. To meet her 
needs of talking to supportive women, Participant 11 turned to an anonymous online 
pregnancy support group, where she was able to avoid judgmental posts:

Cause like, I’m pretty sure that if one of the women, one of the Caucasian women 
or something, knew that they were talking to a 27-year old woman with 3 kids and 
she’s Black, they wouldn’t really give me the type of respect cause we are all 
anonymous on that app. You can’t upload no pictures … and you’re anonymous 
and I think that’s good cause there’s no judgments going on up there, even if the 
stories is wild.

Countering racialized pregnancy stigma

Consistent with Clark et al.’s (1999) biopsychosocial model of racism, encountering 
racialized pregnancy stigma was a source of psychological stress for many participants. And 
as Participant 8 declared, “Stress is one of the main things you don’t need in a pregnancy.”

In response to racialized pregnancy stigma, participants reported using all four types of 
coping in the Africentric framework of coping responses: interconnectedness, spirituality, 
problem-oriented coping, and disengagement (Greer, 2007). For example, participants 
sought emotional support from family members, used prayer, challenged those who 
expressed the abovementioned assumptions, or ignored the encounter.

For some participants, employment helped them distance themselves from these 
assumptions by enabling them to live in or move to neighborhoods that signaled that they 
did not have low incomes or were not receiving public assistance benefits. For others, 
relationship status signified that they did not fit these assumptions. Participant 13, who was 
employed and married, confirmed that she did not fit these assumptions, stating:

I don't have any insecurities when it comes to being Black and pregnant, I think 
because I'm probably not your stereotypical Black and pregnant and single. I am 
married, I am Black, and I am pregnant. So that probably helps me feel even more 
secure, I don’t know it that lets people like make people look different at me. I'm 
not sure, maybe. Me being Black and pregnant, I love it. I’m comfortable, I'm 
secure.

Women embedded in families and communities that validated their personhood and their 
pregnancy had experiences that celebrated their motherhood and were buffered from 
experiences of racialized pregnancy stigma. Participant 4 expressed the joy of being 
pregnant in her supportive community: “It’s exciting because everybody’s like supportive 
and they rub my stomach and say, ‘Hey little boy, how you doing today?’ They call me 
mom. ‘Hey mom, how you feeling today?’ So, it’s very exciting. It’s a lot of supportive 
people in that area.”

However, ultimately participants expressed a desire to change how Black pregnant women 
were defined in society. Participant 14 articulated, “I think that it's important they know 
there is a lot of us out there who really just want to work and grind and do what we have to

do for our new baby.” Participants countered these assumptions by defining themselves as 
hard working, financially independent, and good providers for their families. Furthermore, 
participants described their aspirations for their children’s economic success, including 
planning to send or having already sent their children to college and desiring that they obtain 
good jobs. Some participants, particularly those receiving public assistance benefits, also 
countered negative assumptions by defining themselves as good mothers. Participant 9 
asserted, “I am a hardworking mother. I’m very dedicated to being a mother.”

Participants described how their families helped them define themselves. Participant 14 
explained that her upbringing helped her respond to discrimination: “I've been blessed 
because the African Americans that I'm around, in the family that I have, we're all very 
proud. We're proud of who we are and where we’re from.” In turn, participants described 
how they were going to bring up their children to conquer negative assumptions. Participant 
22 shared, “I’m gonna explain to her like, you know, there are gonna be some people who 
might look at you a certain type of way. Don’t let it get to you. Don’t let no one talk you 
down.” Or as Participant 13 expressed, “I would definitely tell my child to be confident, to 
be proud; definitely those two things. Be secure with your Blackness. Cause I think that's 
what got me through.” This highlights not only how interconnectedness works as a potential 
coping mechanism, but also the intergenerational consequences of discrimination. This 
underlines the importance of understanding and addressing racialized pregnancy stigma: 
these experiences impact not only women, but also their children.

DISCUSSION

Experiences of racism are common among Black women (Ertel et al., 2012; Vines et al., 
2006): as many as one-quarter of higher SES women report racist experiences in medical 
settings (Krieger & Sidney, 1996; Peters, Benkert, Templin, & Cassidy-Bushrow, 2014; 
Vines et al., 2006). Furthermore, experiences of racism are associated with preterm birth 
(Bower, Geller, Perrin, & Alhusen, 2018) and may contribute to racial disparities in infant 
outcomes. Women burdened by the consequences of gendered racism and other forms of 
stress may be at increased risk for poor pregnancy outcomes (Jackson et al., 2001). In 
particular, Black pregnant women report feeling judged by society because of their 
circumstances and this judgment is a source of stress that they consider to be a risk factor for 
preterm birth (Giurgescu et al., 2013).

Our research explored the experiences of Black pregnant women that may contribute to the 
considerable disparities in birth outcomes they confront. We found that Black pregnant 
women encountered gendered racism specific to pregnancy—which we refer to as racialized 
pregnancy stigma—in a multitude of contexts and that these encounters contributed to the 
sentiment that their pregnancies were devalued in society. Racialized pregnancy stigma may 
contribute to poorer maternal and infant outcomes through increased stress and reduced 
access to quality healthcare, services, resources, and social support, which may in turn lead 
to delays in health seeking behavior, financial and material hardship—inadequate food, 
housing, and medical care (Mayer & Jencks, 1989)—and reduced stress buffering.

In addition to Black women in this study reporting experiences of racism throughout their 
life course, they reported experiencing racialized pregnancy stigma. Women described 
encountering assumptions consistent with the stereotype of welfare mothers, or, more 
insidiously, welfare queens. Ronald Reagan is attributed with coining the term “welfare 
queen” (Hancock, 2004) while campaigning for president in the 1970s (Mooney, 2012). This 
public identity has two main dimensions in the political and media discourse—laziness and 
hyperfertility—which, as Hancock asserts, defines Black women as devalued mothers 
(Hancock, 2004). Rather than Black women with low incomes being perceived as worthy of 
public assistance benefits they are entitled to receive (P. H. Collins, 2000), we found that 
many encountered assumptions that they were burdening society.

Furthermore, we found that participants encountered assumptions about single parenting 
rooted in a historical discourse that blames the disintegration of family structure for 
perpetuating the cycle of poverty and disadvantage in Black families (United States 
Department of Labor Office of Policy Planning and Research, 1965), rather than the 
structural challenges that Black communities confront (i.e., unemployment, wage disparities, 
barriers to education, residential segregation, concentrated neighborhood poverty, and 
incarceration) (Acs et al., 2013). As this and previous qualitative studies show (Giurgescu, 
Banks, Dancy, & Norr, 2013; Harris-Perry, 2011; Murrell, Smith, Gill, & Oxley, 1996; 
Nuru-Jeter et al., 2009), the use of the welfare queen stereotype persists, often regardless of 
a woman’s age, education, income, insurance coverage, marital status, or parity (number of 
births). Thus, the discourse of devaluing Black pregnant women persists.

We found that encountering racialized pregnancy stigma in healthcare settings may lead to 
reduced access to quality healthcare and unsatisfactory healthcare interactions. Encounters 
where healthcare providers recommend tubal ligations by default perpetuate the historical 
control of Black women’s fertility through permanent contraceptive procedures—from the 
negative eugenics of forced sterilization of Black women with low incomes labeled as 
“sexually indiscriminate and as bad mothers who were constrained by biology to give birth 
to defective children” (Washington, 2006), to the coerced sterilization of Black women 
enrolled in Medicaid as a solution to poverty (Roberts, 1997). Research shows single Black 
women perceive their healthcare to be poorer in quality than that of married White women 
(McLemore et al., 2018). Medicaid-insured women perceive that judgmental attitudes and 
stereotypes affect healthcare interactions around contraception, particularly forced 
contraception (Roman et al., 2017). Furthermore, prejudicial experiences, including 
gendered racial stereotypes, in the healthcare setting can overshadow good treatment 
(Benkert & Peters, 2005).

Conversely, we found that women who have non-judgmental interactions with their 
healthcare providers may feel more comfortable sharing important health information, which 
may include risk factors for poor maternal and infant outcomes. Moreover, positive 
healthcare experiences are linked to long-term relationships with healthcare providers 
(Benkert & Peters, 2005). Having continued access to supportive healthcare may improve 
the prevention, detection, and management of complex medical and social conditions, which 
may in turn reduce disparities in pregnancy outcomes.

Encountering racialized pregnancy stigma in other contexts may reduce a woman’s ability to 
address important social determinants of health. Women who experience judgmental social 
service interactions may not enroll in government programs (Stuber, Meyer, & Link, 2008). 
Women who are denied housing may experience homelessness or housing instability. 
Women who experience racialized pregnancy stigma in one grocery store may devote 
additional time and resources to finding a new grocery store. For women who rely on public 
transportation, this situation may present more of a challenge in obtaining basic necessities.

Consistent with previous research, we found that Black pregnant women used a variety of 
coping responses (Benkert & Peters, 2005; Lewis, Mendenhall, Harwood, & Browne Huntt, 
2013; Shorter-Gooden, 2004), which may be the most effective way to minimize stress 
(Everett, Hall, & Hamilton-Mason, 2010). However, avoidant coping responses may not be 
an effective strategy for gendered racism (Thomas et al., 2008). Valuing oneself by 
cultivating a positive self-image and supporting personal development may be a way to resist 
negative stereotypes (Shorter-Gooden, 2004). Black women traditionally cope with 
oppression through family networks and Black community institutions (P. H. Collins, 2000), 
and within the context of family and community, the conceptualization of self is found (P. H. 
Collins, 2000). Cultivating family and community networks may help Black pregnant 
women define themselves.

An additional form of gendered racism that may negatively impact pregnancy is the 
assumption that Black boys and men are dangerous (Jackson, Phillips, Hogue, & Curry-
Owens, 2001). Women reported that anticipating that their sons would encounter this 
assumption, particularly by police, was an additional source of psychological stress. The 
burden of protecting children from gendered racism before and during pregnancy may 
increase the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes (Jackson et al., 2001). Nuru-Jeter and 
colleagues recommend the development of a more comprehensive racism measure that 
assesses the anticipation of future discrimination for women and their children (Nuru-Jeter 
et al., 2009).

The strengths of this study include using purposeful sampling to gain perspectives from 
women of different socioeconomic groups, as many studies have only included women of 
higher SES, and enrolling numerous women to explore all relevant codes and themes. 
However, using primary source of financial support as a measure of SES may not be as 
comparable as other measures such as income or education. Additionally, our findings may 
be unique to New Haven and not transferable to other settings.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY

Participants reported encountering harmful racist assumptions and discriminatory treatment 
in both healthcare and community settings, and that supportive families and communities 
helped buffer them from experiences of racialized pregnancy stigma. Racism is deeply 
entrenched in virtually every aspect of society in the US. However, we may be able to reduce 
the way racialized pregnancy stigma manifests in specific settings that are relevant to 
pregnancy outcomes by instituting bias training for healthcare and social service providers; 
screening for racialized pregnancy stigma in healthcare settings and providing evidence-

based coping strategies; and creating pregnancy support groups in healthcare and community 
settings. Broader interventions in the community and society include developing a discourse 
that values Black women and their pregnancies and addressing the structural challenges that 
Black communities confront.

CONCLUSION

This study contributes to a growing body of evidence for the need to achieve reproductive 
justice to address racial inequities in health. Racialized pregnancy stigma influences Black 
pregnant women’s access to and quality of healthcare, social services, resources, and social 
support; contributes to stress; and may contribute to poorer maternal and infant outcomes. 
Understanding and addressing racialized pregnancy stigma may reduce intergenerational 
consequences of discrimination. Further research on racialized pregnancy stigma and 
maternal and infant health is warranted.

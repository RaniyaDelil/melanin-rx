 Prepregnancy Body Size, Gestational Weight Gain, and Risk
 of Preterm Birth in African-American Women

 Lauren A. Wise* Julie R. Palmer* Linda J. Heffner^ and Lynn Rosenberg*

 Background: Studies of the association of prepregnancy body mass
 index (BMI) and preterm birth have been inconclusive, and no
 studies have examined the effect of central adiposity on risk. There
 is also uncertainty about optimal gestational weight gain among
 Black women.

 Methods: Using self-reported prospective data from the Black
 Women's Health Study, we investigated the relation of preterm birth

 to prepregnancy BMI (kg/m2), waist circumference, and gestational
 weight gain among 7840 singletons born to black women, ages
 21-44, during 1995-2003. We compared mothers of 1114 infants
 born 3 or more weeks early (597 spontaneous preterm births and 517
 medically-indicated preterm births) with mothers of 6726 term
 infants. We used generalized estimating equation models to derive

 multivariable odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
 Results: Relative to normal weight women (BMI: 18.5-24.9), un
 derweight women (BMI: <C 18.5) were at increased risk of both
 preterm birth subtypes; obese women (BMI >30.0) were at in
 creased risk of medically-indicated preterm birth and very early
 spontaneous preterm birth (<32 weeks' gestation). Waist circum
 ference, a measure of central adiposity, was positively associated
 with medically-indicated preterm birth. Among obese women, av
 erage gestational weight gain in the second and third trimesters of
 <0.4 or >0.6 lbs/wk was associated with an increased risk of both

 preterm birth subtypes.
 Conclusions: Our data suggest that underweight increases risk of
 both preterm birth subtypes, while obesity increases risk of medi
 cally-indicated preterm birth and only a subgroup of spontaneous
 preterm births (<32 weeks' gestation). Central adiposity was an
 independent risk factor for medically-indicated preterm birth only.
 Among obese women, gestational weight gain within the range
 recommended by the 2009 Institute of Medicine report (0.4-0.6
 lbs/week in the second and third trimesters) was associated with the

 lowest risk of preterm birth.

 black women as white women1"3 and is a leading cause of

 Preterm birth in the U.S. is nearly twice as common among
 infant morbidity and mortality.1,4'5 In 2006, preterm birth
 accounted for 12.8% of all births, and its prevalence has been

 on the rise among single and multiple gestations.1 Although
 rates for spontaneous preterm birth have declined slightly for
 black women during 1989-2000, rates for medically-indi
 cated preterm birth have increased.6 The ethnic disparity in

 preterm birth is not fully explained by established risk factors

 such as personal history of preterm birth, intrauterine infec
 tions, and low socioeconomic status.7

 The prevalence of obesity has increased in the U.S.,

 especially among black women of childbearing age.8'9 High
 body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), a measure of absolute body
 fat,10 is positively associated with intrauterine infections,11

 systemic inflammation,12"14 dyslipidemia,12'15 and hyperin
 sulinemia,16 all of which may increase risk of preterm
 birth.11-14 Conversely, obesity is correlated with longer cer

 vical length,17'18 which would protect against preterm birth.
 Central adiposity, excess body fat in the upper trunk region,
 has also been increasing in the U.S.19 and is associated with
 several hormonal and metabolic changes in reproductive
 aged women, independent of BMI.20"22

 The obesity epidemic in recent decades has paralleled

 the increase in preterm birth rates, particularly medically
 indicated preterm birth. An unanswered question is whether
 obesity is associated with preterm birth. The literature on
 obesity and risk of preterm birth is inconclusive,23 and there

 are no studies of central adiposity in relation to preterm birth.
 Using data from the Black Women's Health Study, we
 assessed the relation of prepregnancy BMI, waist circumfer

 ence, and gestational weight gain to risk of preterm birth.

 Study Population

 The Black Women's Health Study is a prospective

 cohort study of 59,000 African-American women aged 21 to
 69 at baseline (1995) 24 Women were enrolled through ques
 tionnaires mailed primarily to subscribers of Essence maga
 zine. The baseline questionnaire elicited detailed data on
 demographic, lifestyle, reproductive, and medical history
 variables. Health information is updated biennially through
 mailed questionnaires; follow-up through 2003 (the period of

 data collection on births) exceeded 80%. The Institutional
 Review Board at Boston Medical Center approved the study.

 Assessment of Pregnancy Outcomes

 On the 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003 questionnaires,
 women reported whether they had given birth to a liveborn or
 stillborn child in the previous 2 years. For singleton births,
 women were asked "did the doctor say this child was born at

 least 3 weeks early?" and, if yes, how early (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
 9, or >10 weeks), and whether the birth was early due to
 preterm labor for no known reason or early rupture of
 membranes (spontaneous preterm birth), or medically-indi
 cated labor or cesarean section (medically-indicated preterm
 birth). Due dates and birth dates were also elicited for a more
 precise estimate of gestational age.

 Validation of Pregnancy Outcomes

 Clinically, preterm birth is defined as a birth occurring

 <37 weeks of gestation from the date of the last menstrual
 period.25 In the Black Women's Health Study, we defined
 preterm birth as a birth occurring "3 or more weeks early."
 The prevalence of preterm birth in our sample (15.2%) is
 similar to that based on national data for black babies born

 <37 weeks (15.6%).25 We obtained birth registry data from
 the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to validate
 self-reported gestational age and infant birth weight among
 singletons born to Black Women's Health Study participants
 who lived in Massachusetts at some point during 1995-2003.
 These women were similar to the larger birth cohort in
 baseline characteristics (mean BMI, 25.6 vs. 25.9; mean age,
 28.6 vs. 28.4 years; mean education, 15.2 vs. 15.1 years;
 parous, 52.0%) vs. 54.0%; spontaneous preterm birth, 8.2%)
 vs. 8.2%; medically-indicated preterm birth, 7.5% vs. 7.1%).
 Birth records were successfully matched for 76% of single
 tons (167/232). Of the 23 participants who reported a preterm
 delivery, 21 (91%) had gestations <37 weeks documented by
 the registry (11/12 spontaneous preterm births and 10/11
 medically-indicated preterm births); we prioritized the last
 menstrual-period (LMP) estimate of gestational age, unless
 the clinical estimate indicated a shorter gestation.

 Assessment of Maternal Anthropometric
 Factors

 In 1995, women reported their height (feet and inches),

 current weight (pounds), weight at age 18 (pounds), current
 waist circumference (inches) at level of umbilicus, and hip
 circumference (inches) at widest location. Weight was up
 dated on all follow-up questionnaires. We used BMI to
 measure overall obesity, and waist circumference to estimate
 total abdominal fat.26 Waist circumference is correlated with

 metabolic abnormalities such as hyperinsulinemia, hyperten
 sion, and high triglyceride levels.26 Weight and BMI data
 were derived from the questionnaire preceding the question
 naire on which a woman reported the birth. For women
 currently pregnant, data were taken from an earlier question

 naire. Women reported their pregnancy weight gain using the
 following categories: <10, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29,
 30-34, 35-39, >39 pounds.

 We used a gestational-weight-gain formula developed
 by Dietz et al27 that accounts for expected weight gain per
 trimester and gestational age. The rate of weight gain is
 typically low in the first trimester, and higher and linear in the

 second and third trimesters.28'29 Assuming a constant rate of
 weight gain across trimesters will create an upward bias
 because women with shorter gestation are misclassified as
 having lower weight gain. Therefore, we estimated weight
 gain during the second and third trimesters by subtracting an
 expected average weight gain during the first trimester from

 total gestational weight gain and then dividing by gestational
 weeks minus 14 weeks.27 First-trimester weight gain was
 based on Institute of Medicine data,27'28 which estimates an
 average gain of 5 lbs for underweight women, 3.5 lbs for
 normal-weight women, and 2 lbs for overweight and obese
 women.

 Validation of Anthropometric Measures

 In a validation study of physical activity and anthro
 pometry among Black Women's Health Study participants
 from the Washington D.C. area (2001),30 we enrolled the first
 115 women who responded to a mailed invitation (n = 900).
 Pearson correlation coefficients between self-reported and
 technician-measured weight, height, BMI, and waist circum
 ference were 0.97, 0.92, 0.96, and 0.72, respectively. These
 correlations were not materially different among parous
 women with (n = 10) and without (n = 61) a history of
 preterm birth (BMI: 0.98 vs. 0.97; waist circumference: 0.68
 vs. 0.81). Validation study participants were similar to those
 in the birth cohort with respect to education (15.1 years for

 both) and history of preterm birth (14% vs. 19%).

 Based on gestational weight gain assessed in catego
 ries, the weighted kappa statistic was 0.55 for self-reported
 versus registry-supplied data from the Massachusetts Depart
 ment of Public Health (n = 159 with complete data on both
 measures). Two-thirds of women (107/159) reported their
 weight gain within 1 category of the registry-supplied data.
 Among women who misreported their weight gain by more
 than 1 category, 45% underreported their gain (60% of cases
 and 41% of controls, P = 0.31). Inaccurate reporters were
 more likely than accurate reporters to be parous (61% vs.
 45%, P = 0.05) and have had a preterm birth (18% vs. 6%,
 P = 0.05), but there was little difference with respect to mean
 BMI (27.3 vs. 26.6 kg/m2, P = 0.54), waist circumference
 (31.5 vs. 31.1 inches, P = 0.81), or education (15.1 vs. 15.3,
 P = 0.40).

 Assessment of Covariates

 gravidity, parity, marital status, smoking before and during
 pregnancy, previous preterm birth, participant bom preterm,

 and maternal medical conditions (progestational or gesta
 tional diabetes; pregestational or gestational hypertension; or
 thyroid conditions) were obtained on the baseline and fol
 low-up questionnaires. Information on education was col
 lected in 1995.

 Exclusions

 Analyses were restricted to women under the age of 45
 years who reported singleton births during 1995-2003 (n =
 8718). We applied an upper age limit of 44 because risk
 factors for preterm birth may differ by age (only 15 births
 were contributed by women age 45 or older). We excluded
 women with missing prepregnancy BMI data (n = 96). We
 also excluded births in 1995-1997 to women who were

 currently pregnant at baseline (n = 685) because their body
 measurements could have been distorted. These women were

 permitted to contribute births (n = 190) in subsequent ques
 tionnaire cycles, but their waist and hip circumferences (mea
 sured only in 1995) were set to missing. Women reporting
 preterm births without sufficient data to be classified with
 respect to preterm birth subtype were excluded (n = 97),
 leaving 7840 births for the main analysis (6726 term, 597
 spontaneous preterm births, and 517 medically-indicated pre
 term births). For the waist circumference analysis, based on
 the single measurement from 1995, we further excluded 4181
 births from mothers whose prepregnancy BMI changed (gain
 or loss) by more than one unit since 1995, and 554 births
 from mothers with missing data on waist circumference. This
 left 3105 births for analysis (2638 term, 270 spontaneous
 preterm births, and 197 medically-indicated preterm births).
 Women aged <45 years who were lost to follow-up

 before 2003 (12%) were similar to active participants with
 respect to mean age (30.5 vs. 30.1 years), education (14.8 vs.

 14.4 years), BMI (27.1 vs. 27.3 kg/m2), waist circumference
 (31.4 vs. 31.5 inches), and parity (0.9 vs. 1.0 births).

 equivalent to total weight gain of 11-20 lbs) for obese women
 (BMI >30.0 kg/m2).32

 Generalized estimating equation models33 were used to
 estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
 (CIs) for the association between each anthropometric factor
 (BMI, waist circumference, and gestational weight gain) and
 preterm birth. These models account for any correlation
 resulting from the contribution of more than one birth per
 women (1452 women contributed more than one birth to the
 analysis). Multivariable models were adjusted for question
 naire cycle and predictors of preterm birth identified in the

 literature, including maternal age at delivery, parity, years of
 education, marital status, smoking during pregnancy, previ
 ous preterm birth, and participant bom preterm. Because BMI
 and waist circumference were positively correlated (r =
 0.70), we also conducted models that simultaneously con
 trolled for BMI and waist circumference to assess their

 independent effects. We adjusted for both BMI and waist
 circumference in analyses of gestational weight gain. Missing
 values for covariates were modeled using indicator variables.
 Spearman correlation coefficients for gestational weight gain
 versus BMI was -0.18, and for gestational weight gain
 versus waist circumference, -0.17.

 The effect of obesity on pregnancy outcomes may operate
 through progestational diabetes and hypertension, which have
 independent effects on pregnancy outcomes 34,35 We therefore

 performed secondary analyses in which we controlled for ma
 ternal medical conditions. We examined effect modification

 (statistical interaction) between prepregnancy BMI and gesta

 tional weight gain27,36-38 as well as parity,39-41 because previ
 ous studies have shown evidence of interaction between these

 factors. Tests for interaction were conducted using the likelihood

 ratio test comparing models with and without cross-product
 terms between BMI and each covariate, all coded as polytomous
 categorical variables. Analyses were conducted using SAS ver
 sion 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)42

 Data Analysis

 BMI categories were based on World Health Organi
 zation (WHO) standards.31 We categorized waist circumfer
 ence into quintiles and gestational weight gain in the second
 and third trimesters as "below recommended" (<0.8 lbs/
 week), "within recommended" (0.8-1.0 lbs/week), and
 "above recommended" (>1.0 lbs/week), based on the Insti
 tute of Medicine's32 2009 guidelines that women of normal
 prepregnancy BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) gain an average of 1
 lb/wk (range: 0.8-1.0 lbs/week) during the second and third

 trimesters. This range corresponds to a total weight gain of
 25-35 lbs if the pregnancy is carried to term.32 In stratified

 analyses, we used cut points for average weight gain based on
 prepregnancy BMI, as recommended by the Institute of
 Medicine: 0.6 lbs/wk (range: 0.5-0.7 lbs/week, equivalent to
 total weight gain of 15-25 lbs) for overweight women (BMI =
 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and 0.5 lbs/wk (range: 0.4-0.6 lbs/week,

 RESULTS
 Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with waist
 circumference, smoking during pregnancy, parity, previous
 preterm birth, and maternal medical conditions, and inversely
 associated with gestational weight gain and education (Table
 1). In addition to being associated with BMI, waist circum
 ference was positively associated with smoking during preg
 nancy, parity, being married or partnered, previous preterm

 birth, and maternal medical conditions, and inversely associ
 ated with education and gestational weight gain.

 Risk factors for preterm birth in our cohort included

 increased age, nulliparity, having been bom preterm, previ
 ous preterm birth, low educational attainment, not being
 married, and maternal medical conditions (data not shown).
 Of these factors, nulliparity, having been bom preterm, and
 previous preterm birth were associated with spontaneous

 in these effect estimates. To reduce misclassification due to

 preterm birth. Smoking during pregnancy was positively
 associated with risk of spontaneous but not medically-indi
 cated preterm birth.

 As shown in Table 2, women with BMI <18.5 kg/m2
 had an increased risk of both preterm birth subtypes relative
 to women with BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 after adjustment for all
 risk factors including waist circumference. There was little
 evidence of an association between high BMI and spontane
 ous preterm birth after adjustment for waist circumference. In
 contrast, all BMI categories >30.0 kg/m2 were associated
 with an increased risk of medically-indicated preterm birth
 both before and after adjustment for waist circumference. In
 secondary analyses, adjustment for maternal medical condi
 tions strengthened the association between low BMI and
 medically-indicated preterm birth (BMI <18.5 vs. 18.5-24.9
 kg/m2, OR = 2.0 [95% CI = 1.0-4.0]) and weakened the
 association between high BMI and medically-indicated pre
 term birth (BMI >40 vs. 18.5-24.9, 1.1 [0.70-1.8]).

 We observed a positive association between waist cir
 cumference and preterm birth, which was largely accounted

 for by medically-indicated preterm birth: ORs for this sub
 type increased monotonically with increasing waist circum
 ference (Table 2). Associations with spontaneous preterm
 birth were much weaker and did not demonstrate a dose

 response relation. Adjustment for BMI made little difference

 parity-related changes in waist circumference,43 we excluded
 246 births from mothers who contributed more than one birth

 during 1995-2003; results were similar to the main analyses
 (data not shown). Control for maternal medical conditions (a

 potential causal intermediate) weakened but did not eliminate
 the association between waist circumference and medically
 indicated preterm birth: the multivariable ORs comparing
 waist circumference 27.0-28.9, 29.0-31.9, 32.0-34.9, and
 >35.0 with <27.0 inches, were: 2.0 (1.1-3.4), 1.9 (1.1-3.3),
 2.0 (1.1-3.7), and 2.1 (1.1-4.3), respectively.

 Low and high gestational weight gain were associated
 with an increased risk of both preterm birth subtypes (Table

 2). After further adjustment for BMI and waist circumfer
 ence, the association between low gestational weight gain and

 medically-indicated preterm birth weakened, while the asso

 ciations between high gestational weight gain and both pre

 term birth subtypes strengthened. Results were similar after

 adjustment for maternal medical conditions (data not shown).

 subtype were generally stronger in the <32-week gestation
 category. In addition, obesity was associated with an in
 creased risk at <32 weeks' gestation, and this association
 strengthened with further control for maternal medical con

 ditions. Relative to BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, multivariable ORs
 for BMI 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, 35.0-39.9, and >40.0 kg/m2
 were: 1.1 (0.6-1.8), 2.2 (1.2-3.8), 2.5 (1.1-5.7), and 3.2
 (1.3-7.9), respectively. Results for medically-indicated pre
 term birth are not presented because only 49 of these births
 occurred before 32 weeks.

 Associations between average gestational weight gain
 in the second and third trimesters and preterm birth, within
 levels of prepregnancy BMI, are shown in Table 4. Among
 obese women only, average gestational weight gain below or
 above the range recommended by the Institute of Medicine32
 was associated with an increased risk of overall preterm birth
 and of spontaneous preterm birth. Results were generally
 similar for medically-indicated preterm birth, although
 among obese women, only "above recommended" gestational
 weight gain was associated with increased risk. Interactions
 between BMI and gestational weight gain were statistically
 significant overall and within each subtype of preterm birth
 (test for interaction P < 0.001). Results using more extreme
 cutpoints for gestational weight gain (<0.5 and >1.5 lbs/
 week)27 were consistent with those in Table 4, with the
 exception of low gestational weight gain among normal
 weight women: ORs comparing <0.5 versus 0.5-1.4 lbs/
 week were elevated for all preterm births (2.4 [1.7-3.4]),
 spontaneous preterm births (2.2 [1.5-3.4]), and medically
 indicated preterm births (2.6 [1.6-4.4]).

 No appreciable differences in association were found
 by parity status for any of the anthropometric variables in
 relation to either preterm birth subtype (data not shown). The
 mean difference in elapsed time between the completion of
 the questionnaire on which anthropometric variables were
 reported and the date of conception (defined as infant's due
 date minus 40 weeks' gestation) was 24.6 weeks for term
 births and 30.1 weeks for preterm births. However, further
 control for this variable did not alter the results (data not
 shown). To minimize the influence of incomplete weight loss
 from a previous pregnancy, we restricted our sample to
 women who had not had a birth within the previous 2 years
 (n = 5338 births; 4560 term, 410 spontaneous, and 368
 medically-indicated preterm births). The overall ORs for
 preterm birth in association with underweight, waist circum
 ference, and gestational weight gain were similar to the
 original ORs (data not shown), but were weaker for the BMI
 >40.0 category (1.1 [0.74-1.7]). Finally, because control for
 previous preterm birth or parity might have resulted in over

 adjustment for factors that affected the pregnancy under study

 and also the previous pregnancies,44 we repeated our analyses
 without adjustment for these variables. As expected, the ORs
 slightly increased but were not materially different from the
 main results (data not shown).

 In this prospective study of African-American women,
 we found a positive association between prepregnancy un
 derweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) and preterm birth, despite the
 small number of women in this low BMI category. We also

 observed a positive association of prepregnancy obesity (BMI
 ^30.0 kg/m2) with medically-indicated but not spontaneous
 preterm birth overall. However, very early spontaneous pre
 term birth (<32 weeks) was positively associated with
 prepregnancy obesity. Results did not differ materially by
 parity status. The positive association between prepregnancy
 BMI and medically-indicated preterm birth weakened appre

 ciably after adjustment for maternal medical conditions, sug
 gesting the association might be explained in part by condi

 tions such as gestational diabetes or hypertension. In contrast,
 the results for very early spontaneous preterm birth (<32

 weeks) did not change with adjustment for maternal medical

 conditions, indicating a different mechanism for an effect.

 While some studies have reported positive associations
 between maternal overweight or obesity and preterm birth (all

 subtypes combined),39'40,45"47 others found no association37,48"54
 or inverse associations41,55"57 Most,27,36,39,40'45,46 but not all55
 studies, have shown positive associations between maternal

 obesity and very early preterm birth (all subtypes combined); 2

 of these studies found a positive association among nulliparous

 women only.39,40 In the studies that examined preterm birth

 subtypes separately,17,38'41'47,58 obesity was consistently associ
 ated with an increased risk of medically-indicated preterm
 birth17'38'41'47'58 but its relation to spontaneous preterm
 birth was unclear. Studies of the relation between obesity
 and spontaneous preterm birth have reported null,38'58
 inverse17'41 and positive associations for preterm prema
 ture rupture of membranes only.47

 Our data show a positive monotonic association be
 tween waist circumference and medically-indicated preterm
 birth, but little evidence for an association with spontaneous

 preterm birth. There are no previous studies on this topic with
 which to compare our results. If the mechanism operates
 through insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, then our
 findings are supported by a study of pregnant women in
 which insulin levels were higher in women with upper-body
 obesity than in women with lower-body obesity or lean
 women, following an oral glucose tolerance test.59 Golden
 berg and Culhane60 suggest that preterm birth is mediated by
 increased systemic inflammation, which may be influenced

 by conditions such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and

 hypertension. Given that central adiposity is strongly related
 to insulin resistance, systemic inflammation is a possible
 mechanism by which waist circumference increases risk of
 preterm birth. Recent studies linking preterm birth to C-re

 active protein (a marker of systemic inflammation) support

 this hypothesis.12-14

 In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published revised
 guidelines for gestational weight gain based on a woman's
 prepregnancy BMI, defined according to WHO stan
 dards.32 The main change was for obese women: whereas
 at least 15 lbs had been recommended in 1990, the revised

 guidelines recommend a "narrow and specific" range of

 11-20 lbs.32 Women with prepregnancy BMI <18.5 kg/m2
 are advised to gain 28-40 lbs, those with BMI 18.5-24.9
 kg/m2 are advised to gain 25-35 lbs, and those with BMI
 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 are advised to gain 15-25 lbs.32

 There is conflicting evidence about the joint association

 of gestational weight gain and maternal obesity with preterm
 birth: studies have reported both decreased27,36'38 and in
 creased37 risks of preterm birth associated with low gesta

 tional weight gain among obese women.23 Some researchers
 argue that black women should strive for weight gain toward
 the upper end of the recommended ranges based on prepreg

 nancy BMI to reduce risk of low birthweight, which is
 correlated with low gestational weight gain.28 While smaller
 studies of prepregnancy body weight and adverse pregnancy
 outcomes have included black women,27,51 only one stratified

 by race/ethnicity.51 In the present study, gestational weight
 gains below and above those recommended by the 2009
 Institute of Medicine report were associated with increased
 risks of both spontaneous and medically-indicated preterm
 birth among obese women only. Among normal weight women,
 only very low gestational weight gain (<0.5 lbs/week in the
 second and third trimesters) was associated with increased
 risks of both preterm birth subtypes, in agreement with the
 literature.23,39

 A limitation of our study is that anthropometric and

 preterm birth data were self-reported. Although there was
 excellent agreement between self-reported and technician
 measured height and weight in our validation study,61 agree
 ment between self-reported and technician-measured waist
 circumference (measured in 1995 only) and gestational
 weight gain (reported after the index pregnancy) was not as

 high. Due to the prospective reporting of variables other than

 gestational weight gain, error would likely be nondifferential
 and would generally bias the effect estimates towards the
 null.62 Another limitation is the time variability between the
 anthropometric measurements and the date of conception,
 although secondary analyses suggested minimal influence of
 this variation on our results.

 Our validation study indicated high accuracy of self

 reported preterm birth relative to registry data, and the overall

 prevalence of preterm birth was comparable to that based on
 national data.25 We analyzed preterm birth subtypes sepa

 rately in an attempt to clarify the etiologic role of the factors
 under study. The proportion of women classified as having
 had a spontaneous or medically-indicated preterm birth was
 consistent with national data from 1989-2000 on preterm

 birth subtypes among black women.6 Nonetheless, because
 preterm birth was self-reported and not based on clinical
 assessment, it is unclear whether self-reported gestational age
 was based on ultrasound or LMP methods. Furthermore, the

 degree to which self-reported data can distinguish between
 preterm birth subtypes is questionable and caution should be
 used when interpreting subtype-specific results. Most anthro

 pometric and covariate data were reported before the index
 pregnancy. Because true prepregnancy BMI is seldom available

 in registries or hospital databases (which represent the largest

 sources of data from studies to date36'39,46'55) researchers often
 use BMI in early pregnancy. However, by the time a woman is

 seen for her first prenatal visit, she may have gained (or lost)

 several pounds compared with her true prepregnancy weight40
 This may explain the lower agreement between self-reported

 and registry-supplied gestational weight gain data in our study.
 We controlled for several potential confounders not
 routinely available in large registries, including education,
 smoking history, maternal health conditions, and whether the

 participant was born preterm. The large sample size permitted
 an informative assessment of risk factors in the overall

 dataset, but there were small numbers in some stratified

 analyses, and the examination of numerous anthropometric
 variables and subtypes of preterm birth may have increased
 the potential for false positives. Cohort retention was satis
 factorily high, enough to reduce the influence of selection
 bias. In addition, respondents and nonrespondents were sim
 ilar with respect to factors such as BMI, waist circumference,
 and parity.

 Because women must be literate to participate in a
 study that collects data by mailed questionnaires, most Black
 Women's Health Study participants have completed high
 school.24 About 85% of black women of the same ages
 nationally have graduated high school,63 so our results should

 apply to a large segment of the U.S. black population.

 The relation of obesity to preterm birth is relevant to
 African-American women because they are disproportion
 ately affected by both conditions. Our data suggest that
 obesity increases risk of medically-indicated preterm birth
 (all gestations) and very early spontaneous preterm birth, and
 that underweight increases risk of both preterm birth sub

 types. Among obese women, gestational weight gain within
 the range recommended by the 2009 Institute of Medicine32

 report was optimal in reducing risk of preterm birth.

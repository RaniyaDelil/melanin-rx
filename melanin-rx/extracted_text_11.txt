A prospective study of the effect of childbearing on weight
gain in African-American women. Obes Res. 2003;11:
1526 –1535.
Objective: To prospectively assess the influence of bearing
a first, second, or later child on weight gain among African-
American women in the context of other risk factors.
Research Methods and Procedures: Data were obtained in
a prospective follow-up study of African-American women
from across the U.S. who are participants in the Black
Women’s Health Study. Postal questionnaires were used to
collect baseline data in 1995 and follow-up data in 1997 and
1999. Parous and nulliparous women (11,196) (21 to 39
years old at baseline), of whom 1230 had a singleton birth
during follow-up, are the subjects of the present analyses.
We assessed change in BMI (kilograms per meter squared)
in relation to childbearing during 4 years of follow-up, with
use of multivariable linear regression to control for impor-
tant risk factors.
Results: During 4 years of follow-up, the BMI of partici-
pants increased by an average of 1.6 kg/m2, equivalent to a
weight gain of (cid:1)4.4 kg. Women who had a child during
follow-up gained more weight than women who remained
nulliparous, and those who had a first child gained more
than those who had a second or later child. The weight gain

associated with childbearing increased with increasing base-
line BMI and was appreciable among heavier women. For
example, among women with a baseline index of 36, the
increase in BMI for women who bore a first child was 1.1
kg/m2 more than that of nulliparous women, equivalent to a
difference in weight gain of (cid:1)3.0 kg.
Discussion: Childbearing is an important contributor to
weight gain among African-American women.

Introduction
Obesity is epidemic in the United States (1–3). In 1999
and 2000, 50% of African-American women were obese
(BMI (cid:1) 30 kg/m2), and 15% were severely obese (BMI (cid:1)
40), compared with 30% and 5%, respectively, of white
women (1). The elevated prevalence of obesity among Af-
rican-American women is present across all educational
levels (4).

Obesity-related risks among U.S. African-American
women are clearly documented and striking (4 –10). Death
rates from coronary heart disease and diabetes among Af-
rican-American women are, respectively, 1.5 and 2.6 times
those in white women (11). Longitudinal data have estab-
lished the association of obesity with increased risks of
coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes,
and premature death (8,12–16). Obesity is also associated
with several cancers and a range of other conditions (3).

The influence of childbearing on weight gain among
African-American women is not well documented. Most
studies of weight change after childbearing have lacked a
comparison group and, thus, could not account for the gain
that often occurs with aging (17). Only four reports from
prospective studies with a comparison group have assessed
changes in adiposity associated with childbearing (18 –21);
the studies included (cid:1)4500 women, of whom fewer than

Childbearing and Weight Gain in Black Women, Rosenberg et al.

1000 were African American. In the two studies that in-
cluded African-American women, the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)1 study (20) and
a follow-up of participants in the first National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (21), African-American and
white primiparas gained (cid:1)3 and 1.8 kg, respectively, more
than nulliparas for 5 (20) or 10 (21) years of follow-up;
multiparas did not gain more than nulliparas (20).

In view of the magnitude of the health problems that
obesity poses, additional information is needed on causes of
weight gain among African-American women. We prospec-
tively assessed the influence of bearing a first, second, or
later child on weight gain in U.S. African-American
women, using a comparison group of nulliparous women.
We also assessed other potential influences on weight gain,
such as sedentary lifestyle. Based on data from the Black
Women’s Health Study (BWHS), the present study is the
largest yet of African-American women and allowed for a
thorough examination of the influence of childbearing on
weight gain in the context of other risk and modifying
factors.

Research Methods and Procedures
The BWHS began in 1995 when 64,500 U.S. African-
American women 21 to 69 years old enrolled in a long-term
health study of African-American women by completing
mail health questionnaires (22,23). Over 80% of the respon-
dents were from California, the District of Columbia, Geor-
gia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, and
Virginia. The questionnaires elicited information about
many factors, including medical and reproductive history,
height, current weight, weight at age 18, exercise, cigarette
smoking, and diet (using a 60-item food frequency ques-
tionnaire) (24). Height was reported in feet and inches and
weight in pounds. After a run-in phase, 59,000 women have
been followed through biennial follow-up mail question-
naires that obtained information on weight, births, smoking,
exercise, incident disease, and contraception, among other
factors. The 1997 and 1999 questionnaires were completed
by 91% and 87%, respectively, of the final 1995 cohort.

The present study is based on the 4-year follow-up period
from 1995 to 1999 and used data from the 1995, 1997, and
1999 questionnaires. The 1997 and 1999 questionnaires
obtained data on births in the two preceding years, 1995 to
1997 and 1997 to 1999, respectively, and pregnancy status
at the time of questionnaire completion. To clearly assess
the effect of childbearing and allow sufficient time for
women to return to a stable weight after they had borne a
child, we included in the childbearing group only women

Adults; BWHS, Black Women’s Health Study; CI, confidence interval.

who had one birth in 1995 to 1997 and none in 1997 to
1999. Potential subjects were 11,637 women who met the
following criteria: 21 to 39 years of age at entry; completed
the 1995, 1997, and 1999 questionnaires; reported height on
the 1995 questionnaire; did not report the occurrence of
cancer on any of the questionnaires; not pregnant at the time
of completion of any of the questionnaires; and nulliparous
or parous in 1995 and had a singleton birth in 1995 to 1997
and none in 1997 to 1999, or nulliparous from 1995 to 1999.
We excluded women whose weight was missing in 1995 or
1999 (256 women), who were (cid:2)95 pounds in 1995 (23
women), more than 300 pounds in 1995 (127 women), or
who had gastric surgery (35 women). The final sample,
11,196 women, included 9966 who remained nulliparous,
598 nulliparous women who had a first child, 387 primip-
arous women who had a second child, and 245 women with
two or more children who had another child during follow-
up.

We fit multivariable linear regression models to assess
the relation of childbearing and other factors to 1999 BMI
using SAS version 8.2 software (SAS/STAT Users’ Man-
ual; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), with women who re-
mained nulliparous serving as the comparison group. When
we tested for interactions of parity with other variables by
including interaction terms in the regression model, we
found an interaction between parity and 1995 BMI (as a
continuous variable) (p (cid:2) 0.001). The relation of 1995 BMI
to 1999 BMI was not linear, and the addition of a quadratic
term for 1995 BMI was highly significant (p (cid:2) 0.001).
Thus, in addition to terms in the model for the main effects
of 1995 BMI (as a continuous variable) and parity, we
included a linear interaction term between parity and 1995
BMI (continuous) and a quadratic term for 1995 BMI (con-
tinuous). The adjusted R2 for the final multivariable model
was 0.845. To assess goodness of fit for the final model, we
plotted Studentized residuals vs. predicted values and par-
tial regression plots. Visual inspection of these plots showed
no evidence of lack of fit.

We included other factors in the linear regression that
were associated both with parity and with 1999 BMI—age
at menarche, BMI at age 18, marital status, cigarette smok-
ing, vigorous physical activity, television or video watch-
ing, medication-treated depression, oral contraceptive use,
and use of levonorgestrel implants or medroxyprogesterone
acetate injections. The data for these factors were derived
from the 1999 questionnaire except for age at menarche,
BMI at age 18, marital status, and years of education, which
were derived from the 1995 questionnaire. Terms were not
included for intentional weight loss of at least 15 pounds
(1999) and total caloric intake and percent calories from fat
(1995) because these were unrelated to 1999 BMI in mul-
tivariate analyses (data not shown). In addition, a term was
not included for teenage birth (birth before age 20) because
this variable was not associated with 1999 BMI.

The results from the multivariable linear regression anal-
yses were unchanged after exclusion of women who had
miscarriages during 1995 to 1999. Endometriosis or infer-
tility problems could have affected women’s ability to bear
children. Results were unchanged after the exclusion of
women with endometriosis or infertility at baseline from the
comparison group of nulliparous women.

We assessed whether having a child during follow-up
influenced vigorous physical activity in 1999 in linear re-
gression analyses, in which the outcome variable was hours
per week of vigorous activity in 1999, and the predictors
were hours per week of vigorous activity in 1995, parity at
the end of follow-up, and age in 1995. The categories of
vigorous activity in 1999 were (in hours per week): none,
(cid:2)1, 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10(cid:3), and they were
coded as 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 8, and 10. In 1995, 1 and 2
hours a week were separate categories; they were coded as
1 and 2.

We assessed the validity of self-reported weight and
height among 115 participants from the Washington, D.C.
area who participated in a physical activity validation study
conducted by Dr. L. L. Adams-Campbell at Howard Uni-
versity Cancer Center. The participants were weighed and
measured by clinic personnel in 2000 or 2001. The Spear-
man correlation coefficient for self-reported weight (mean
175.3 pounds) with measured weight (mean 180.7 pounds)
was 0.97. The Spearman correlation coefficient for height
reported on the 1995 questionnaire (mean 64.4 inches) with
measured height (mean 64.0 inches) was 0.93.

Results

Between 1995 and 1999,

the mean BMI among the
11,196 BWHS participants increased by 1.6 kg/m2 from
26.5 kg/m2 to 28.1 kg/m2. There was a loss or no change in
weight for 27% of participants. BMI increased by 1.4 kg/m2
or more ((cid:1)3.8 kg or more in weight) for one-half of the
participants and 4.9 kg/m2 or more ((cid:1)13.5 kg or more in
weight) for 10%. The mean BMI increase was 2.0, 1.7, 1.5,
and 1.3 kg/m2 for women 21 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, and
35 to 39 at entry, respectively. The overall proportion of
women who were obese increased from 24% to 32%. In
1999, that proportion ranged from 26% among women 21 to
24 years of age at entry to 37% among women 35 to 39.

Childbearing

As shown in Table 1, childbearing was associated with
age: 20% of nulliparous women were 21 to 25 years of age
in 1995 compared with 18% of women who had a first child,
10% of women who had a second child, and 7% of women
who had a third or later child. Over one-half of parous
women were married compared with 16% of nulliparous
women. Parity decreased with increasing education. Parous

1528 OBESITY RESEARCH Vol. 11 No. 12 December 2003

women had lower BMIs at age 18, participated less in
vigorous physical activity, and used hormonal contraception
less than nulliparous women. Weight gain during the index
pregnancy was greater for women who had a first child than
for women who had a second or later child.

For comparison with earlier studies, we first assessed parity-
related weight changes in multivariable linear regression anal-
yses without an interaction term for parity with 1995 BMI.
From 1995 to 1999, the BMI of women who became primap-
arous increased by an estimated 0.4 kg/m2 [95% confidence
interval (CI), 0.2, 0.6] more than that of nulliparous women;
the BMI of women who had a second child increased by 0.3
kg/m2 (95% CI, (cid:4)0.03, 0.6), and that of women who had a
third or later child increased by 0.3 kg/m2 (95% CI, (cid:4)0.03,
0.7) more than that of nulliparous women.

When we included an interaction term for parity with
1995 BMI, we found that parity-associated changes in BMI
differed according to 1995 BMI. As shown in Figure 1, the
BMI of women who had a child increased more than that of
nulliparous women, and the increase was greatest for
women who had a first child. In addition, the magnitude of
the difference in BMI change between parous women and
nulliparous women increased as baseline BMI increased.

Predicted values of parity-related changes in BMI during
follow-up based on the model with an interaction term are
given in Table 2 for women with characteristics represen-
tative of the study cohort. We chose women 25 to 29 years
old because this was a common age for childbearing; the
values selected for other factors in the model, such as
physical activity, represent the most common values in the
cohort. We estimated BMI changes for women with base-
line BMIs of 23, 27, 32, and 36 kg/m2 to represent women
who were of normal weight, overweight, obese, or more
obese, respectively. Table 2 indicates that as baseline BMI
increased, the BMI gain associated with childbearing in-
creased. For example, among women with a baseline BMI
of 23, the estimated BMI increase was 1.7 kg/m2 among
nulliparous women and 1.9 kg/m2 among women who had
their first child; by subtraction, the BMI gain associated
with having a first child was 0.2 kg/m2. However, among
women with a baseline BMI of 36, the predicted BMI
increase was 1.3 kg/m2 in nulliparous women and 2.4 kg/m2
among women who had their first child; by subtraction, the
BMI gain associated with bearing a first child was 1.1
kg/m2. Results were similar when women of other ages and
with other characteristics were assessed.

Table 2 also gives predicted values of weight change in
kilograms from the model (shown in parentheses in the
table). For women with a BMI of 23 in 1995, the predicted
change in weight for nulliparous women was 4.6 kg, com-
pared with 5.2 kg for women who had a first child, a
difference of 0.6 kg. The comparable results for women
whose BMI at baseline was 36 were a weight gain of 3.6 kg

for nulliparous women and 6.6 kg for women who had a
first child, a difference of 3.0 kg. Results were similar when
the data were stratified according to age at baseline, 21 to
29, and 30(cid:3).

To assess whether weight gain during the index preg-
nancy was related to BMI gain, we carried out linear re-
gression analyses confined to the women who had a child
during follow-up. BMI increases for the categories of
weight gain during pregnancy of 25 to 34 pounds and (cid:1)35
pounds were 0.2 kg/m2 (95% CI, (cid:4)0.2, 0.6) and 0.5 kg/m2
(95% CI, 0.09, 0.9) more than the increase among women
who gained (cid:2)25 pounds during pregnancy. There were no
significant interactions of weight gain during pregnancy
with age, parity, or 1995 BMI.

Women generally reported exercising less in 1999 than in
1995. To assess whether women who had a child during
follow-up decreased exercise more than women who re-
mained nulliparous, we assessed the relation of parity to
hours of exercise per week in 1999 in linear regression
analyses, taking into account hours of exercise per week and

age in 1995. The regression coefficients for parity 1, 2, and
3(cid:3), relative to nulliparity, were (cid:4)0.4 (95% CI, (cid:4)0.6,
(cid:4)0.2), (cid:4)0.2 (95% CI, (cid:4)0.4, 0.08), and (cid:4)0.3 (95% CI,
(cid:4)0.6, (cid:4)0.001), respectively.

Other Factors

Results from the multivariable regression analysis on the
relation of factors other than parity to BMI in 1999 are
given in Table 3. The reference category for each of the
factors is the same as that used to derive the results given in
Table 2. Women under age 30 had larger BMI increases
than older women. BMI at age 18 and exercise were
strongly related to 1999 BMI: The BMIs of women who
were obese at age 18 increased by an estimated 0.9 kg/m2
more than those of women whose BMI was 20 to 24 at age
18, and BMI increased 0.4 kg/m2 for women who did not
exercise at all relative to those who exercised (cid:2)5 hours per
week and 1.1 kg/m2 relative to those who exercised at least
5 hours per week. Increases in BMI in the range of 0.1 to 0.6
were associated with use of injectable or implanted proges-
tin contraceptives, treatment for depression with medica-
tion, nonsmoking, early age at menarche, watching televi-
sion or videos, being single, and lower educational
attainment.

Discussion
Over a 4-year period of follow-up of women 21 to 39
years old at entry to the BWHS, BMI increased by an
average of 1.6 kg/m2, or 0.4 kg/m2 per year, equivalent to a
weight gain of (cid:1)1.1 kg/year. The proportion of women who
were obese increased from 24% in 1995 to 32% in 1999.

These findings are consistent with other data on U.S. Afri-
can-American women (1,25). For example, in a 10-year
follow-up of women who were 18 to 30 years of age at entry
to the CARDIA study in 1985 to 1986, African-American
women gained an average of 1.2 kg/year (25). White
women in the CARDIA study gained 0.7 kg/year.

Childbearing influenced BMI gain among BWHS partic-
ipants. The BMI of women who had a child increased more
than that of nulliparous women, and women who had a first
child gained more weight than those who had a second or
later child. The increase associated with childbearing be-
came larger as baseline BMI increased and was appreciable
among the obese women. For example, among women 25 to
29 years old with a baseline BMI of 36, the BMI increase of
those who had a first child was an estimated 1.1 kg/m2 more
than the increase in nulliparous women, equivalent to a
difference in weight gain of (cid:1)3.0 kg. Whether there is a
similar relation between childbearing and baseline BMI in
white women is not known: The CARDIA and National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey studies (20,21)
indicated that primiparas, but not women with higher parity,
gained more weight than nulliparous women, but did not
assess possible interactions with baseline BMI. In contrast
to predicted weight gain among parous women, predicted
weight gain declined slightly with increasing BMI among
nulliparous women in the BWHS. There was no evidence
that the latter was a cohort effect as the decline was evident
both among women (cid:2)30 and those (cid:1)30 years of age at
baseline.

It seems reasonable to infer that earlier childbearing (26),
greater weights at the beginning of the childbearing years
(1), and greater childbearing-associated weight gain among

African-American women contribute to the higher preva-
lence of obesity in African-American women than in white
women.

Gestational weight gain has increased among American
women in recent years, in line with recommendations aimed
at reducing the number of low-birth weight babies (27,28).
Previous prospective studies with comparison groups did
not collect data on weight gain during pregnancy. Studies
without comparison groups consistently suggest that greater
weight gain during pregnancy is associated with greater
subsequent weight retention (29 –35). BWHS results agree
with this finding. Thus, weight gain of 35 pounds or more
during pregnancy may improve the health of the baby but
might also have an adverse impact on the subsequent weight
of some mothers.

Weight retention after childbirth may be the result of
biologic changes, such as increased leptin levels (36) or
changed behavior. Our finding of a greater decrease in
exercise during the follow-up period among women who
bore a child than among nulliparous women supports the
latter explanation. We have no data on biologic changes.

Low level of exercise was a strong predictor of weight
gain in the BWHS, in accord with many studies (37). We
found no association of total caloric intake and the percent
of calories from fat in 1995 with weight gain. In a validation
study conducted within the BWHS, the food frequency
questionnaire used to measure dietary intake in 1995 was a
poor indicator of total calories but a relatively good indica-
tor of percentage of calories from fat (38). The small excess
in energy intake needed to foster gradual weight gain is
probably beyond the sensitivity of food questionnaires gen-
erally (39). In addition, we had no data on diet in 1999 and
did not assess dietary intake during and after pregnancy. In
line with previous results, smokers gained less weight than
nonsmokers (40). The small BMI increase associated with
oral contraceptive use and the larger gain among women
who used injectable or implanted progestin contraceptives
are known side effects of these contraceptives (41). BWHS
participants who reported a history of medication-treated
depression at baseline gained more weight than women who
did not so report; this gain could be due to the depression,
medication, or both (42,43).

The BMI of women who reached menarche at age 10 or
earlier increased more than that of women whose menarche
occurred later. In addition, the greater a woman’s BMI at
age 18, the greater was the weight gain from 1995 to 1999.
These results suggest that the trajectory toward overweight
begins in puberty, if not earlier, in accord with national data
showing African-American/white differences in weight in
females from childhood onward (3,44). Interventions to
interrupt this trajectory need to start well before adulthood.
The present study has several strengths. The prospective
follow-up design increased accuracy and minimized report-
ing bias relative to studies in which the data are recalled.

The potential for material selection bias was small because
follow-up rates were satisfactory. The study is much larger
than any previous study of childbearing and weight gain in
African-American women. The use of a comparison group
of nulliparous women took into account the weight change
that may accompany aging. Important potential confound-
ing variables were controlled, and the influence of effect
modifiers was assessed. Most weight gain during pregnancy
is lost within the year after the birth (18). Our study design
allowed sufficient time after the birth, at least 2 years, for
the mother’s weight to stabilize. In addition, limiting con-
sideration of the effects of childbearing to women who had
only one child during follow-up eliminated the confounding
effects of other births.

A limitation is that weights and heights in the present
study were self-reported. However, a validation study dem-
onstrated excellent correlations between measured and self-
reported weight and height among BWHS participants.
Random errors in reporting or systematic underreporting of
weight by the heavier women would have diluted associa-
tions with weight gain. Women who weighed more than 300
pounds at baseline were excluded to avoid distortion of the
results by a relatively small number of women with outlying
values of weight. That exclusion could also have resulted in
underestimation of associations with weight gain. A poten-
tial bias could have resulted if women who were excluded
because of missing values on weight differed from the
included women. However, because only (cid:1)2% of potential
participants in the current analyses were excluded for this
reason, any influence on the results would have been small.
We had no information on lactation after the index preg-
nancy. However, although women who lactate for more
than several months may lose weight after a birth faster than
women who do not, most evidence indicates that lactation
does not influence subsequent persistent weight retention
(45,46).

Participants in the BWHS have higher educational attain-
ment, on average, than African-American women nation-
ally. Almost all BWHS participants (97%) have completed
high school or a higher level of education, compared with
(cid:1)83% of U.S. African-American women of the same ages
nationally (47). Because higher educational attainment is
associated with more exercise and lower weight (48), it is
possible that the present results underestimate the contribu-
tion of childbearing to weight gain in the less educated
African-American women who were not eligible for inclu-
sion in the BWHS.

In summary, the present data indicate that childbearing
among African-American women increases weight gain.
The childbearing-related gain increases as baseline BMI
increases and accounts for an appreciable part of the total
gain among heavier women. Interventions to prevent obe-
sity in African-American women should discourage exces-

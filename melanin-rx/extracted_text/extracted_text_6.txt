Abstract

Objective.—Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs most commonly among reproductive 
age women, compatible with a potential role of reproductive factors, although past studies 
including women of mainly European ancestry have yielded conflicting results. We assessed 
relationships of reproductive factors to SLE risk among black women.

Methods.—We followed 58,243 participants in the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS) from 
1995 – 2015 using biennial health questionnaires, on which participants reported reproductive and 
other factors. Self-reported incident SLE cases were confirmed as meeting 1997 American College 
of Rheumatology SLE classification criteria by medical record review. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CI) for SLE for several reproductive factors, controlling for potential confounders.

Results.—During 954,476 person-years of follow-up, 125 incident cases of SLE were confirmed. 
Later age at menarche and longer duration of breast feeding were associated with increased risk of 
SLE. The multivariable HRs were 2.31 (95% CI, 1.30–4.11) for age at menarche ≥15 relative to 
age 12, and 1.73 (95% CI, 1.01 – 2.94) for breast feeding ≥ 6 months relative to none. There were 
no clear associations with parity, age at first birth, menopausal status, hysterectomy, age at 
menopause, or history of endometriosis.

Conclusion.—Our results suggest that later menarchal age and breastfeeding of infants for ≥ 6 
months vs. none may be associated with increased SLE risk among black women, while other 
reproductive factors did not appear related. The biological mechanisms underlying these potential 
associations should be pursued.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects women more 
than men, and black women more than women of other racial/ethnic groups.1–3 As SLE has 
its peak incidence in women during the reproductive years at ages 15 to 40, increasing after 
menarche and declining after menopause, research has focused on potential reproductive and 
menopausal risk factors. However, results of past studies have been somewhat conflicting 
and inconclusive.4–6 In the present study, we assessed reproductive factors, including age at 
menarche, parity, age at first birth, breastfeeding, menopausal status, hysterectomy, and 
endometriosis in relation to SLE risk in a prospective cohort study of black women, a 
population at high risk of SLE. We hypothesized that early age at menarche and menopausal 
status would be associated with increased risk of SLE as they have been in cohorts of white 
women.6

Methods

The Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS).

In 1995, black women ages 21–69 years (median 38 years) from the continental U.S. 
enrolled in the BWHS by completing 14-page health questionnaires; the 59,000 women with 
valid addresses a year later have been followed by biennial questionnaires, on which they 
provide demographic, medical and lifestyle information.7,8 Yearly linkage with the National 
Death Index was used to identify deaths. Follow-up has been successful for >85% of 
potential person-years through 2015. The Institutional Review Board of Boston University 
Medical Center approved the study. Participants indicate their consent by filling out the 
questionnaires; they sign consents for obtainment of medical records.

Reproductive factors.

Participants provided data on age at menarche (<11,11,12–14, ≥ 15 years) at baseline in 
1995. Self-reported parity, age at first birth (years), number of children, menopausal status 
(including hysterectomy), age at menopause (years), and endometriosis were obtained in 
1995, and updated on subsequent biennial questionnaires. Questions on lactation (never, 
ever) (including duration (months)) were asked in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2011 
questionnaires.

Covariates.

Data on current height (inches), and weight (pounds) at age 18 were collected at baseline in 
1995. Additional covariate variables, including current weight was used to calculate body 
mass index (BMI) (>25, 25–29, ≥30 kg/m2), cigarette smoking (never, past, current), and 
alcohol consumption (never, past, current), and use of female hormone replacement therapy 
(ever, never) were obtained in 1995, with updates on subsequent biennial questionnaires.

Age began alcohol consumption (≤ 14 years, >14years/never), age began smoking (≤ 14 
years, >14 years/never), age began oral contraceptive use (≤ 14 years, >14 years/never), and 
BMI at age 18 (<20, 20–24, 25–29, ≥30 kg/m2), were also obtained in 1995. Experiences of 
childhood sexual abuse (ever, never) and physical abuse (ever, never) were collected in 2005, 
and completed parental education (neither parent attended college, at least one parent 
attended college, at least one parent college graduate) was collected in 2009.

SLE cases.

The 1995 questionnaire asked about a list of diagnoses that included “lupus”. Every 
subsequent biennial questionnaire asked about “lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus)” and 
the date of diagnosis. The doctors of women who gave consent were asked to provide copies 
of medical records concerning SLE or to fill out a checklist about the presence of the 1997 
Updated American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for Classification of SLE.9,10 
Medical record review by study rheumatologists (KC, MB) confirmed cases as the presence 
of at least 4 of the ACR SLE classification criteria.

Analytic cohort.

The current analysis assessed data from the baseline questionnaire through ten subsequent 
follow-up cycles (1995–2015). We excluded 757 women who reported SLE diagnosed 
before study entry in 1995. The remaining 58,243 women comprised the analytic cohort.

Statistical analysis.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of reproductive variables with risk of SLE. 
Women contributed person-time over ten biennial questionnaire cycles from baseline in 
1995 until SLE diagnosis, death (N=6,315), loss to follow-up (N=4,328), or end of follow-
up (2015), whichever occurred first (Figure 1). Women who reported SLE, but for whom we 
were unable to obtain medical records to confirm the diagnosis, were censored at the year of 
self-reported diagnosis.

Cox models were jointly stratified by age in 1-year intervals and questionnaire cycle (model 
1). We examined age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, lactation, menopause, and 
endometriosis as individual predictors of SLE. The multivariable model examining age at 
menarche as the predictor included the following covariates from close to the time of 
menarche: age began alcohol consumption, age began smoking, age began oral contraceptive 
use, BMI at age 18, and completed parental education. A second model additionally adjusted 
for ever experiencing childhood sexual abuse and childhood physical abuse. The 
multivariable models for the remaining variables (menopause, parity, age at first birth, 
lactation, and endometriosis) adjusted for the following: alcohol status, smoking status, 
BMI, BMI at age 18, parity, menopausal status (except for menopause), current use of oral 
contraceptives, ever use of female hormone, and age at menarche. Tests for trend were 
performed by entering continuous variables in the multivariable models, using the median 
value within each category as appropriate.

Results

Page 4

During 954,476 person-years of follow-up from entry in 1995 to 2015, 125 incident cases of 
SLE were confirmed: the mean age at diagnosis was 43 years, the mean number of 1997 
ACR criteria for SLE was 5.0 (±1.2), 64% had hematological and 30% had renal 
involvement (Table 1). Table 2 displays the baseline demographic and reproductive 
characteristics of the BWHS cohort and SLE cases in 1995. Compared to the BWHS cohort, 
SLE cases were slightly older at baseline, more educated, less likely to smoke, were younger 
at first birth, and more likely to report ever use of female hormones.

As shown in Table 3, the HR for SLE increased, but not significantly with increasing age at 
menarche (p trend= 0.08). We utilized multivariable models with and without adjustment for 
childhood sexual and physical abuse. The multivariable HR for SLE for onset of menarche 
at 15 years or older relative to menarche at age 12, the mean in the cohort, was 2.29 (95% 
CI, 1.29–4.06); after additional adjustment for childhood sexual and physical abuse the HR 
was 2.31 (95% CI, 1.30–4.11). Early menarche (<11 years) was not statistically associated 
with increased risk of SLE: HR=1.31 (95% CI, 0.72, 2.39).

Parity, age at first birth, and number of children were not related to SLE risk. The 
multivariable-adjusted HR associated with breast feeding for at least 6 months relative to 
none was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.01 – 2.94). When we further assessed longer duration of lactation 
the multivariable HR for ≥ 12 months (13 cases) was unchanged at 1.73 (95% CI, 0.90–
3.34). There were no consistent increases or decreases in SLE risk across having had a 
hysterectomy, age at menopause, or endometriosis.

Discussion

In the present study, late onset of menarche was associated with an increased risk of SLE: 
the HR for onset of menarche at age 15 or older compared to the cohort mean of 12 years, 
was more than doubled. A study by Parks et al,11 reported that among postmenopausal 
women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 1999–2004), 
ANA prevalence was associated with an older age at menarche (p=0.019; age 16–20 versus 
10–12 years POR=3.0, 95%CI 1.6, 5.9). Late age at menarche was also previously 
associated with increased SLE risk in a case-control study of Japanese women (282 cases).5 
However, SLE risk was elevated for early age at menarche, at 10 or younger, rather than late 
age in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Nurses’ Health Study II cohorts, composed 
primarily of White women. No association was found for age at menarche and SLE in a 
case-control study from North and South Carolina with 240 cases, of whom almost two-
thirds were black.4 In the current study, the HR for SLE among those who reported the 
youngest age at menarche (< age 11) was also elevated at 1.31, but with only 17 cases in this 
category this result was not significant.

Age at menarche may be a marker for stress-mediated effects on the immune system, such as 
child abuse, which may in turn influence risk of SLE. For example, Boynton-Jarrett and 
colleagues found that severity of childhood sexual abuse was associated with risk for early 
menarche, while physical abuse was associated with both early and late menarche in the

NHS II cohort.12 In an analyses involving the BWHS, Wise et al. found that both childhood 
sexual and physical abuse were positively associated with early menarche.13 Recent analyses 
in both the NHS II14 and the BWHS15 have each found associations between childhood 
physical and sexual abuse and risk of SLE. For that reason, we controlled for both childhood 
sexual and physical abuse in the current analysis, but this did not materially change the 
estimates.

Ellis’s theory of stress reactivity16 hypothesizes a U-shaped (curvilinear) association 
between early life adversity and stress reactivity. For example, family support or stress may 
influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in response to early adversity, 
resulting in either pathway hyper-activation (early menarche) or suppression (late 
menarche). We did not assess types or levels of family support in our analyses.

With regard to parity, risk of SLE was decreased in the Japanese study,5 and unassociated in 
the NHS,6 the Carolina study,4 and the present study.

Several studies have associated high levels of prolactin in blood with SLE disease activity or 
development in humans17 and mouse models.18 Prolactin is a hormone primary secreted by 
the pituitary gland and has stimulatory effects on the immune system. Prolactin stimulates 
the production of milk in breastfeeding mothers, and serum levels of prolactin increase 
minutes after breastfeeding.19 Breastfeeding for over 6 months, compared to never 
breastfeeding, was associated with an increased risk of SLE in the multivariable-adjusted 
models in the present study, although the risk was not further elevated among those who 
breastfed their babies for 12 months or more, and it is not clear that this is more than a 
chance finding. In contrast, duration of lactation was inversely associated with risk in the 
Carolina Study,4 and not associated in the NHS.6 The relationship between long-term 
breastfeeding, prolactin levels, and SLE needs further investigation.

Earlier age at menopause (<47 years) was associated with a greater than two-fold increased 
risk of SLE among women in the NHS cohort.6 This increase, however, was observed 
primarily among those women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy (surgical 
menopause) and were therefore younger at the onset of menopause.

There was no clear association with age at menopause or with hysterectomy in the present 
study.

History of endometriosis was associated with increased SLE risk in the NHS,20 and with a 
non-significant increased risk among whites but not blacks in the Carolina study,4 whereas 
there was no significant association in the present study based on only 14 SLE cases 
reporting endometriosis.

The present study has several strengths. The data were collected using a prospective cohort 
study design, minimizing the possibility of reporting bias. Potential SLE cases were 
reviewed and confirmed by study rheumatologists to meet the ACR classification criteria for 
SLE. A number of potential confounding factors were controlled in the analysis. Study 
limitations include limited statistical power because of the relatively small number of 
incident SLE cases. We conducted multiple tests which increased the possibility of false

positives. Additionally, several of the reproductive factors and the child abuse exposure 
information were collected retrospectively. The BWHS is not a probability sample. 
Participants must be literate to complete mailed questionnaires and they underrepresent the 
15% of US black women nationally who have not completed high school.21 Conversely, 
participants reside in all regions of the United States. Thus, the present results might apply 
to a large population of U.S. black women.

In summary, this study suggests that later age at menarche may be associated with increased 
SLE risk among black women. The few studies of age at menarche in relation to SLE risk 
are conflicting and a clear conclusion cannot be drawn. Results concerning long duration of 
breast feeding are conflicting as well. It appears that if reproductive factors are related to 
SLE, the associations are not strong enough to have clearly manifested across many studies 
to date.

All models were adjusted for age and period

Page 12

b,c

Age at menarche was adjusted for age started smoking ≤ 14 years, age started alcohol intake ≤ 14 years, age first OC ≤ 14 years, BMI at age 18, 

parental education, ever child sexual abuse, and ever child physical abuse.

b,d

Parity, age at first birth, lactation, menopause, and endometriosis were adjusted for alcohol status, smoking status, BMI, BMI at age 18, 

parity(except parity), menopausal status (except menopause), current OC use, ever use of female hormone, age at menarche.

e

Restricted to parous women. We used an indicator variable of having three or more births against having less than three births to control for parity.

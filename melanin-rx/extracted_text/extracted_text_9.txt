Abstract

The authors assessed the risk of uterine leiomyomata in relation to reproductive factors and hormonal
contraception in a prospective cohort study of US Black women. From March 1997 through March
2001, the authors followed 22,895 premenopausal women with intact uteri and no prior self-reported
diagnosis of uterine leiomyomata. The authors used age- and time-stratified Cox regression models
to estimate incidence rate ratios for self-reported uterine leiomyomata, confirmed by ultrasound or
hysterectomy, in association with selected reproductive and hormonal factors. During 76,711 person-
years of follow-up, 2,279 new cases of ultrasound- or hysterectomy-confirmed uterine leiomyomata
were self-reported. After adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and other
reproductive covariates, the risk of ultrasound- or hysterectomy-confirmed leiomyomata was
inversely associated with age at menarche, parity, and age at first birth and positively associated with
years since last birth. Overweight or obesity appeared to attenuate the inverse association between
parity and uterine leiomyomata. Current use of progestin-only injectables was inversely associated
with risk. No consistent patterns were observed for other forms of hormonal contraception.
Reproductive history is an important determinant of leiomyomata risk in premenopausal US Black
women. Progestin-only injectables may reduce risk.

Uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) are clinically recognized in about 30 percent of reproductive-
age women (1) and are a major source of gynecologic morbidity. Symptoms include pelvic
pain, reproductive dysfunction, and heavy menstrual bleeding (2,3). Uterine leiomyomata are

the fifth leading cause of hospitalizations for gynecologic conditions unrelated to pregnancy
in women aged 15–44 years (4) and the primary indication for hysterectomy among women
of all ages in the United States (5,6). Clinical diagnoses of uterine leiomyomata are from two
to three times more common in Black women than White women (5,7–9), and Black women
have an earlier age at first diagnosis (7,9,10) and more numerous and symptomatic tumors than
do White women (9,10).

Although the etiology of uterine leiomyomata remains poorly understood, growth of these
tumors is thought to depend on ovarian hormones (1,11). Epidemiologic studies conducted in
predominantly White populations suggest that risk is inversely associated with age at
menarche, parity, and age at first birth and positively associated with years since last term birth
(12–20). Findings on oral contraceptives are inconsistent (12–19,21) but tend toward an inverse
association, particularly for preparations with a higher dose of progestin (14). The present study
uses prospective data from a nationwide cohort of African-American women to evaluate risk
of uterine leiomyomata in relation to reproductive factors and hormonal contraception. We
expand on the scope of existing research by examining different constituents of oral
contraceptives.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study population

The Black Women’s Health Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study designed to examine
risk factors for major illnesses in African-American women. In 1995, 64,500 participants aged
21–69 years were enrolled through questionnaires mailed to subscribers of Essence magazine,
members of Black professional organizations, and friends and relatives of respondents (22).
The baseline questionnaire in 1995 elicited information on demographic and behavioral
characteristics, reproductive and contraceptive histories, health care utilization, and medical
conditions. Updated information is obtained by postal questionnaire every 2 years. After a run-
in phase, the cohort comprised 59,000 women. Follow-up of this cohort has exceeded 80
percent in each questionnaire cycle.

Follow-up for the present analysis began in March 1997, the start of the second questionnaire
cycle, because data on the method of confirmation for leiomyomata were first obtained on the
1999 follow-up questionnaire. Starting with the 53,322 women who completed the 1997
questionnaire, we restricted our sample to premenopausal women with intact uteri because
leiomyomata are rare after menopause (3). We therefore excluded women who reported natural
menopause (n = 5,143), hysterectomy (n = 6,625), bilateral oophorectomy (n = 4,175), medical
menopause (n = 218), or unknown menopausal status (n = 522) at the start of follow-up. We
further excluded women who reported a diagnosis of leiomyomata before 1997 (n = 10,450),
who completed neither 1999 nor 2001 follow-up questionnaires (n = 2,193), or who provided
no information about year of diagnosis (n = 99) or confirmation type (n = 208). Finally, analyses
excluded women with incomplete exposure or covariate information (n = 789). The remaining
22,895 women were followed for incidence of leiomyomata in the subsequent 4 years. The
proportion of women with missing data did not vary appreciably by any of the reproductive
factors examined.

Assessment of outcome

The diagnosis of leiomyomata is often suspected when an enlarged irregular uterine contour
is palpable on pelvic examination. Ultrasound examination is the primary noninvasive standard
used to confirm diagnoses. Although histologic evidence is the “gold standard” (3),
histologically confirmed cases represent only 10–30 percent of cases for whom ultrasound
evidence is available (7,23). Studies limited to histologic cases may spuriously identify risk

factors associated with large tumor size, symptoms, or treatment preference (23). Therefore,
our outcome definition included confirmation by hysterectomy or ultrasound. Ultrasound has
been shown to have high sensitivity (99 percent), specificity (91 percent), and positive
predictive value (96 percent) relative to histologic evidence (24,25).

On the 1999 and 2001 follow-up questionnaires, women were asked if they had been diagnosed
with “fibroids” in the previous 2-year interval and if “yes,” the calendar year in which they
were first diagnosed and whether their diagnosis was confirmed by “pelvic exam” and/or by
“ultrasound/hysterectomy.” A diagnosis was classified as “hysterectomy-confirmed” if the
participant reported hysterectomy in the same questionnaire cycle under a separate question.

Incident cases were defined as women who reported on the 1999 or 2001 questionnaire a first
diagnosis of “fibroids” confirmed by ultrasound or hysterectomy. The index date for each case
was defined as the midpoint of the reported calendar year in which the diagnosis was confirmed.
Women with diagnoses confirmed only by pelvic examination (n = 412) were not included as
cases in primary analyses because their diagnoses may represent other pathology (7,26).

We assessed the accuracy of self-reported leiomyomata in a random sample of 248 ultrasound-
or hysterectomy-confirmed cases. These women were mailed supplemental questionnaires
regarding their initial date of diagnosis, method of confirmation, symptoms, and treatment, and
they were asked for permission to review their medical records. We obtained medical records
for 122 of the 128 women who gave us permission and confirmed the self-report in 117 women
(96 percent). The proportion of women reporting on the supplemental questionnaire that their
diagnosis was first confirmed at ultrasound or hysterectomy did not differ among those who
did (n = 128) and did not (n = 50) release their medical record (98 percent vs. 98 percent).
Likewise, the proportion of women reporting the presence of symptoms prior to the detection
of leiomyomata did not differ materially among those who did and did not release their medical
record (73 percent vs. 60 percent). Among the 178 cases who completed the supplemental
survey, 70 percent reported symptoms of uterine leiomyomata prior to diagnosis of the
condition. Moreover, 55 percent were diagnosed after seeking medical care for the condition;
most of the remaining cases were detected by “routine physical exam” (32 percent).

Assessment of reproductive factors and hormone use

On the 1995 survey, information was obtained on age at menarche, number of livebirths and
stillbirths (parity), age at each birth, total duration of lactation, and number of spontaneous or
induced abortions. We also asked about history of infertility, defined as “trying to become
pregnant for at least one year without success,” age at which it first occurred, and its causes.
A complete history of oral contraceptive use was obtained in 1995. For each year from age 13
years to age at baseline, the duration of oral contraceptive use in three categories (<6, 6–9, >9
months) was recorded. We calculated the duration of each reported interval (taking the
midpoint of each category) and then summed all of the intervals from the baseline and follow-
up questionnaires to ascertain the total duration of oral contraceptive use.

Information on oral contraceptive brand was obtained on follow-up questionnaires and was
used to categorize oral contraceptive use in terms of type, dose, biologic potency of estrogen
and progestin, and formulation (monophasic, multiphasic, or progestin-only “minipills”) (27,
28). We used Dickey’s method (27), based on the entire formulation of the oral contraceptive,
to classify oral contraceptives into three categories of estrogenic potency (low: <30 mg;
medium: 30–39 mg; and high: ≥40 mg) in ethinyl estradiol equivalents per tablet and three
categories of progestational activity (low: <1 mg; medium: 1 mg; and high: >1 mg) in
norethindrone equivalents per day. Oral contraceptive progestins were classified as either
estranes (norethindrone group) or the biologically more potent gonanes (norgestrel group)

(28). Women who had used oral contraceptives for 6 or more months were classified as ever
users.

Norplant (Population Council, New York, New York) and Depo-Provera (Pharmacia-Upjohn,
Kalamazoo, Michigan) are long-acting, progestin-only contraceptives, the former being a
subdermal implant releasing levonorgestrel at a constant rate over 5 years and the latter given
as a 150-mg dose of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) by deep intramuscular
injection every 90 days. Current use of progestin-only implants and injectables was ascertained
on the baseline and follow-up questionnaires.

Data analysis

Each participant contributed person-time from March 1997 until the diagnosis of uterine
leiomyomata, menopause, loss to follow-up, death, or March 2001 (end of follow-up),
whichever came first. Age- and time-stratified Cox regression models were used to estimate
incidence rate ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals for leiomyomata associated with
reproductive exposures of interest (29). To control for age, calendar time, and any two-way
interactions between these two time scales, we stratified our analyses jointly by age in 1-year
intervals at the start of follow-up and calendar year of the current questionnaire cycle (30).
Time-varying covariates were reassigned after 2 years according to the updated exposure
values reported on the 1997 and 1999 questionnaires, with the exception of infertility and
lactation, which were measured in 1995 only. The Anderson-Gill data structure was used to
update all time-varying covariates (31), and “exact” methods were used to handle tied event
times.

To qualitatively assess the linearity of continuous variables, we categorized variables into
equally spaced categories and plotted the midpoint of each category versus the log hazard. We
also performed likelihood ratio tests that compared the best-fitting restricted cubic spline model
for the data (using stepwise selection techniques from a richly parameterized 10-knot initial
model) with the linear model nested within it (32). Variables that did not satisfy these
assessments of linearity were modeled nonparametrically using restricted cubic splines (32).

A covariate was included in multivariate analyses if the literature supported its role as a risk
factor or if adding the covariate to a model containing all other predictors of leiomyomata
changed the incidence rate ratio by 10 percent or more (33). Tests for trend across categories
of variables were calculated by including a single ordinal variable coded as the category of
exposure (34); the “unexposed” category (e.g., nulliparous) was excluded from dose-response
assessment.

Multivariate models controlled for age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, years since last
birth, lactation, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, smoking, current alcohol
consumption, and education. Departures from the proportional hazards assumption were tested
by the likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without interaction terms for covariates
versus age. In this same manner, we evaluated effect modification by education, body mass
index (35), smoking, and alcohol intake on the main associations of interest (36).

The median age at menarche among Black Women’s Health Study participants was 12 years
(table 1). Parous women had on average two births, with a median age at first birth of 22 years
and a median time since last birth of 9 years. Forty-three percent of parous women reported
having breastfed for 3 or more months. The majority of women had used oral contraceptives
at some point in their lives, and 23 percent were currently using them. The prevalence of
progestin-only injectable use was 3 percent. In 1995, 11 percent of women reported a history

of infertility. Among the 68 percent whose cause was investigated, the most commonly reported
causes were the following: “not found” (34 percent), tubal blockage (23 percent), and ovulatory
disorder (15 percent).

During 76,711 person-years of follow-up, 2,279 new cases of uterine leiomyomata confirmed
by ultrasound (n = 2,006) or hysterectomy (n = 273) were reported. Based on all cases of uterine
leiomyomata (ultrasound or hysterectomy confirmed), risk was inversely related to age at
menarche after adjustment for potential confounders (table 2). The multivariate incidence rate
ratio for women with an age at menarche of 15 or more years versus less than 11 years was 0.7
(95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.5, 0.8), and a dose-response relation was apparent.
Results were similar when hysterectomy-confirmed cases were considered separately.

Parity was associated with a 30 percent lower risk of leiomyomata (table 2). There was no
evidence of a dose-response reduction in risk with each additional birth. Since previous
research has shown a positive association between infertility and leiomyomata (14,17),
especially at earlier ages (12,16), we were concerned that use of a nulliparous referent group
could have yielded a spurious inverse association with parity if it contained a large proportion
of infertile women. However, the inverse association for parity remained after the exclusion
of women with a history of infertility (data not shown). Although infertility was not an
independent risk factor for leiomyomata overall, we observed an inverse association for age
at first occurrence (ptrend = 0.01). Spontaneous and induced abortions were unrelated to risk
(table 2). All results were similar for hysterectomy-confirmed cases, with the exception of
parity: The multivariate incidence rate ratio comparing parous with nulliparous women was
1.4 (95 percent CI: 1.0, 2.0).

Risk of leiomyomata was inversely related to age at first birth, independent of years since last
birth and other covariates (table 2). The multivariate incidence rate ratio for women with an
age at first birth of 30 or more years versus less than 20 years was 0.6 (95 percent CI: 0.4, 0.9),
and there was evidence of a dose-response relation. Findings were similar for hysterectomy-
confirmed cases. In an attempt to replicate findings from a recent National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) study (37), we repeated the analyses among
nulliparous and primiparous women and controlled for a history of infertility. Contrary to the
j-shaped pattern observed in the NIEHS study, we found the same inverse linear pattern
produced by our main model based on all cases. Compared with nulliparous women, the
multivariate incidence rate ratios for parous women with an age at first birth of less than 25,
25–29, 30–34, and 35 or more years were 0.9 (95 percent CI: 0.8, 1.0), 0.6 (95 percent CI: 0.5,
0.7), 0.4 (95 percent CI: 0.3, 0.5), and 0.3 (95 percent CI: 0.2, 0.5), respectively.

Time since most recent birth was positively related to the risk of leiomyomata among parous
women, independent of age at first birth and other covariates (table 2). Women who had a birth
in the past 5 years had less than half the risk of leiomyomata compared with women whose
last birth was 5 or more years ago. This pattern of risk was uniform within categories of age
at first birth (data not shown). Duration of lactation was not associated with risk of uterine
leiomyomata. Results were similar for hysterectomy-confirmed cases.

Relative to noncurrent use of hormonal contraception, current use of oral contraceptives was
not associated with risk of leiomyomata (table 3), while current use of progestin-only
injectables was associated with a 40 percent reduction in risk (95 percent CI: 0.4, 0.9). When
past users of injectables were excluded, the inverse association remained. While weakly
elevated risks were found for initiation of oral contraceptive use at younger ages, no pattern
of increased risk was found for past or current oral contraceptive use, duration or recency of
use (table 3), hormonal potency, classification of progestin, or formulation of oral contraceptive
(table 4). Mutual control for estrogenic and progestational potency did not materially influence

these findings. Among hysterectomy-confirmed cases, either results were null (table 3) or
numbers were too small to examine oral contraceptive characteristics separately (table 4).

We did not observe any effect modification by age, alcohol consumption, smoking, or
education on the main associations of interest. The association with parity appeared to vary by
body mass index (pinteraction = 0.01). Among women with a body mass index below 27 (the
median), the incidence rate ratio for parous relative to nulliparous women was 0.6 (95 percent
CI: 0.5, 0.6); among women with a body mass index of 27 or above, the incidence rate ratio
for parous relative to nulliparous women was 0.8 (95 percent CI: 0.7, 0.9).

Restriction of our analytical sample to women who reported a Papanicolaou smear in the past
2 years yielded analogous findings to those based on the original sample (data not shown).
Moreover, results were similar when cases confirmed by pelvic examination (n = 404) were
included as part of the outcome definition, censored at the time of diagnosis, or classified as
noncases as presented in this paper.

DISCUSSION

The present results are the first prospective data on risk factors for uterine leiomyomata in
Black women. The Nurses’ Health Study II published prospective data on uterine leiomyomata
(17), but their case group comprised only 5 percent Black women, and the results on
reproductive factors were not stratified by race. The rate ratios observed in the present study
are consistent with those found in studies of White women. Risk was inversely associated with
age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, and current use of injectables and positively associated
with years since last birth. While age at first oral contraceptive use was weakly inversely
associated with risk, null associations were found for duration and recency of use, hormonal
potency, classification of progestin, and formulation of oral contraceptive.

Epidemiologic studies on age at menarche in relation to uterine leiomyomata have shown an
inverse association (13,16–20). The inverse association found in the Black Women’s Health
Study and other studies supports the hypothesis that women with an early age at menarche
have, on average, increased menstrual cycling and greater lifelong exposure to bioavailable
estrogens, which are thought to promote growth of uterine leiomyomata. Early age at menarche
has been correlated with higher levels of estradiol (38) and estrone and lower levels of sex
hormone binding globulin (39,40).

The decreased risk of leiomyomata in parous compared with nulliparous women is consistent
with results from previous research (12,14,17,18), although our study did not confirm the dose-
response reduction in risk for parity that has been shown in some (12,14,18), but not all (17),
studies. The lack of an association for spontaneous or induced abortion agrees with findings
from other studies (12,41) and suggests that the protection conferred by pregnancy may relate
to full-term pregnancy only. Inverse associations for parity remained after the exclusion of
women reporting a history of infertility and after accounting for lifetime lactation. Although
lactation is thought to suppress ovarian hormones (37), our study does not support an
association with leiomyomata, in accord with the two other studies that have examined lactation
(18,19). Excess body weight appeared to weaken the inverse association observed for parity,
as women with a body mass index above the median had only half the parity-related reduction
in risk of women below the median.

Hormonal and nonhormonal mechanisms may explain the inverse association with parity. First,
higher parity reflects a decrease in menstrual cycling. Second, a full-term pregnancy induces
significant long-term changes in levels of ovarian hormones and growth factors (42–46),
including lower levels of plasma and urinary estradiol (38,44), higher levels of sex hormone
binding globulin (44), and long-term decreases in basal levels of prolactin (46,47). Third, full-

term pregnancy may cause a reduction in estrogen receptor levels in myometrial tissue, which
could reduce the sensitivity of leiomyomata to hormonal stimuli (48). Fourth, extensive uterine
tissue degradation and remodeling occurs both during and after full-term pregnancy (49).
Collagenases and other tissue-degrading enzymes induce apoptosis and may inhibit the growth
of preneoplastic or neoplastic cells (49).

In line with other studies (12,16,17), the risk of uterine leiomyomata in the Black Women’s
Health Study increased with increasing time since last birth. The time-risk relation between
parity and risk of leiomyomata is similar for uterine cancer (50), which supports the hypothesis
that the protection conferred by parity may be related to pregnancy-related hormonal changes
or the mechanical shedding of transformed myometrial cells. A recent NIEHS study
demonstrated that a first birth occurring in the mid-reproductive years (ages 25–29 years) was
most protective against leiomyomata, while births at other ages showed no association with
risk (37). Our study did not replicate these findings but, rather, showed an inverse linear relation
with age at first birth, regardless of whether analyses included primiparous or all parous women.

There was no clear association between oral contraceptives and risk of uterine leiomyomata
in the Black Women’s Health Study. While two studies found that ever users of oral
contraceptives were at reduced risk (14,16,18), others found little or no association (12,13,
19) or increased risk (21). Only one study found a reduction in risk as the number of years of
oral contraceptive use increased (14). Our finding of an increased risk associated with early
age at first oral contraceptive use is consistent with that of one other study (17). In contrast to
a study that found a reduction in risk associated with increasing dose of progestin (14), we
found no association with progestational potency or progestin classification. Although the
validity and clinical relevance of potency information have been questioned (51), we carried
out these analyses because other diseases, such as breast cancer (52), ovarian cancer (53), and
vulvar vestibulitis (54), have been linked to oral contraceptive potency.

Current use of progestin-only injectables was associated with a decreased risk of uterine
leiomyomata relative to nonuse of hormonal contraception. A Thai study showed a similar
inverse relation between the use of DMPA, an injectable progestin, and surgically confirmed
leiomyomata (18). In that study, the reduction in risk was most pronounced for women using
DMPA for 5 or more years and for current users. In the Black Women’s Health Study, the
inverse association for use of progestin-only injectables remained unchanged after excluding
past users. This suggests that the inverse association was not influenced by the inclusion of
women with subclinical leiomyomata who may have discontinued DMPA because of irregular
bleeding.

Use of DMPA has been associated with an increase in gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse
frequency, modification of the endometrial lining, suppression of gonadotropins, and reduced
secretion of estradiol (55,56) and progesterone. Progestins may also downregulate the estrogen
receptor in leiomyomata (57). Estradiol concentrations in DMPA users resemble
postmenopausal levels, and the degree of estradiol suppression may increase with longer use
(55). Findings for progestin-only oral contraceptives and implants were uninformative because
of small numbers.

In the Black Women’s Health Study, information on reproductive and contraceptive histories
was collected before the diagnosis and confirmation of leiomyomata. This prospective design
eliminates the potential for recall bias because cases reported their exposures prior to their
diagnosis of leiomyomata. Although it is still possible that leiomyomata developed years before
their clinical diagnosis, it is unlikely that women would have modified their lifestyle without
the experience of symptoms or the clinical diagnosis of the condition.

We validated self-reported uterine leiomyomata through a detailed supplementary
questionnaire and review of medical records. We were able to confirm the diagnosis in 96
percent of the cases for whom we obtained medical records. We cannot rule out the possibility
that women who released their records reported with greater accuracy than those who did not.
Results based on the most secure case definition, hysterectomy-confirmed leiomyomata, were
similar to those based on the larger group that included ultrasound-confirmed cases. The one
exception was that parity was not inversely associated with risk in the hysterectomy group.
Differences between ultrasound- and hysterectomy-confirmed cases may be related to factors
associated with patient or physician preference regarding the choice of treatment rather than
the true incidence of leiomyomata (23). For example, if cases who had completed childbearing
were more likely to choose hysterectomy as a form of contraception than cases who had not
finished childbearing, then our association for parity would have been upwardly biased.

As in most other large-scale epidemiologic studies (7,16), Black Women’s Health Study
participants were not systematically screened for uterine leiomyomata. Because of the high
incidence of these tumors and their tendency to be asymptomatic, some cases were undoubtedly
misclassified as noncases. In a recent NIEHS study that screened randomly selected women
aged 35–49 years from an urban health plan, 59 percent of premenopausal Black women who
had not reported a previous diagnosis of leiomyomata showed ultrasound evidence of the
condition (9). The degree of misclassification increased with age (9). In the Black Women’s
Health Study, if misclassification was unrelated to any of the reproductive factors examined,
the observed incidence rate ratios would have been biased toward the null. However, among
women aged less than 35 years, a “low-risk” group in which misclassified cases would have
constituted a smaller proportion of true noncases, findings were similar to those for the entire
study group.

If any reproductive factor influenced the detection of leiomyomata, over- or underestimation
of the incidence rate ratio could have occurred. For example, women who visited a physician
for any factor that increased their likelihood of pelvic examination (e.g., prenatal care) would
have been more likely to have an incidental diagnosis of leiomyomata, which would have
upwardly biased the incidence rate ratio for parity. Given that parity was inversely associated
with leiomyomata in the Black Women’s Health Study, we would expect the true association
to be even stronger than what we observed. Likewise, the observed incidence rate ratios for
oral contraceptive use may have been inflated because of detection bias. Data from our
validation study show that a high proportion of cases (70 percent) had symptoms prior to the
detection of uterine leiomyomata and that 55 percent of cases sought medical care for symptoms
prior to detection of the condition. While this leaves room for detection bias, restriction of the
sample to women reporting a Papanicolaou smear within the previous 2 years did not
appreciably change our results, suggesting that detection bias played a minor role.

Findings generated from a follow-up study can be compromised if response is low within each
cycle of follow-up and there is permanent loss to follow-up. The Black Women’s Health Study
response of over 80 percent reduces the potential for selection bias. Length of follow-up did
not differ significantly by parity, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, or age at menarche,
but significant differences were noted for education. In a comparison of women with less than
12 years versus 17 or more years of education, the mean length of follow-up was 37.1 months
and 39.8 months (p < 0.001). When we used Robins’ method of inverse probability of censoring
weighting (58) to account for differential loss to follow-up—a method that weights women
who were not lost to follow-up more heavily to account for women who were, given the same
covariate history—our results did not change materially.

Black Women’s Health Study participants may differ from the general population of US Black
women in ways that may affect the generalizability of our findings. However, the median ages

at menarche, age at first birth, and body mass index in the cohort were similar to those
documented in nationwide representative studies of Black women (59–61). Moreover, we did
not find any effect modification by education, smoking, or alcohol consumption on the main
associations of interest. Therefore, the present findings are likely to extend to other US Black
women.

Reproductive history is an important determinant of uterine leiomyomata in US Black women.
Several national studies show that Black girls have an earlier mean age at menarche than White
girls (59,60,62,63) and that Black women are more likely to begin and end childbearing at
earlier ages (61). However, evidence from studies including Black women and White women,
combined with the modest associations found in the Black Women’s Health Study, suggests
that reproductive factors explain only a small fraction of the Black-White difference in rates
of uterine leiomyomata (16,17).

§

Reference category for all comparisons. All analyses exclude current users of progestin-only injectables and implants (29 cases; 2,167 person-years).

¶

In ethinyl estradiol equivalents per day. Estrogenic activity of entire tablet, as measured by mouse uterine assay (27). Omits 106 cases and 5,338 person-

years with missing information on oral contraceptive dose.

#

In norethindrone equivalents per day: 1 mg of norethindrone = 1 mg of norethindrone acetate = 1 mg of ethynodiol diacetate = 0.2 mg of norgestrel =
0.1 mg of levonorgestrel (27). Omits 106 cases and 5,338 person-years with missing information on oral contraceptive dose.

**

Omits 34 cases and 1,780 person-years with missing information on oral contraceptive brand.

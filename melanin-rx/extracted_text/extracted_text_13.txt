How Implicit Bias Contributes to Racial Disparities
in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in the United States

Bani Saluja, MPH1 and Zenobia Bryant, PhD2

Abstract

Over the past two decades, maternal mortality rates have declined around the world. In the United States, however,
700 women die each year as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications. This represents a 50% increase in the
U.S. maternal mortality rate over the same time period. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), the pregnancy-related mortality ratios vary signiﬁcantly by race, with White women experiencing 13.0
deaths per 100,000 births, compared with 42.8 deaths per 100,000 births for Black women, from 2011 to 2015.
Multiple studies suggest that implicit bias—deﬁned as the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding,
actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner—is most likely a contributing factor to this alarming racial health
disparity. The failure to recognize the pain of African American patients, regardless of whether it is conscious or
unconscious, has the potential to affect the way obstetrician/gynecologists counsel patients about treatment options
when it comes to chronic conditions, contraception, vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, and the management of
ﬁbroids. In this article, we will review implicit bias and the impact it can have on health care and health disparities.

Introduction

Over the past two decades, maternal morbidity and

mortality (MMM) rates have declined around the world.
However, MMM rates have been increasing steadily in the
United States—the only developed country in which this has
occurred.1 Each year, *700 women die because of pregnancy
or delivery complications in the United States, but approxi-
mately three in ﬁve pregnancy-related deaths could have been
prevented.2 Furthermore, pregnancy-related mortality rates
vary signiﬁcantly by race. According to data from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Pregnancy
Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS) spanning 2007–2016,
White women experienced 12.7 deaths per 100,000 births
compared with 40.8 deaths per 100,000 births for Black
women.3 Understanding what contributes to this racial divide
in maternal health outcomes is of vital importance because it
can illuminate where and how to tackle such a multifaceted
issue and focus the scope of public health prevention programs.

Decades of research indicate that this serious U.S. public
health problem involves structural racism and its negative ef-
fects on the minds and bodies of all racial groups, especially
people of color.4 Structural racism refers to the summative
ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through
mutually reinforcing systems such as housing, education,
media, employment, and health care.5 Today, an imbalance of
inherited resources and persisting discrimination restrict the
access of many Americans of color to better jobs, quality ed-
ucation, political power, healthy neighborhoods, and quality
health care.4 As a result, implicit, discriminatory attitudes, and
behaviors have permeated the U.S. health care system and
likely are a powerful contributing factor to the high negative
maternal health outcomes experienced by Black women.

What Is Implicit Bias?

Implicit bias is different from overt and intentional dis-
crimination and develops early in life from exposure to

repeated reinforcement of stereotypes perpetuated by struc-
tural discrimination.6 The mere existence of cultural ste-
reotypes regarding certain social or racial groups has the
potential to inﬂuence one’s behavior toward individuals
from the stereotyped group.6 Implicit bias is deﬁned as
thoughts and feelings that exist outside of conscious
awareness and subsequently can affect human understand-
ing, actions, and decisions unknowingly.7,8 These biases
cause attitudes about other people based on personal char-
acteristics, including, but not limited to, age, race, and
ethnicity.8 Because implicit bias is unconscious, it can be
difﬁcult to measure, and actions resulting from it often are
challenging to recognize and control.7

Measuring Implicit Bias

Implicit bias cannot be measured well with standard (self-
report) survey questions.9 The most common tool used to assess
implicit bias is the Implicit Association Test (IAT). This tool is
available online and is a computerized, timed dual categori-
zation task that measures implicit preferences by bypassing
conscious processing.6,8 The IAT has been used in hundreds
of studies across a variety of disciplines, including psychology,
health, political science, and market research.9 Demonstra-
tions of the IAT can be found at https://implicit.harvard.edu.

Implicit Bias, Health Care Providers,
and Maternal Health

Implicit bias is directly correlated with lower quality of
care for patients and may be activated under stressful
working conditions.7,10 The potential inﬂuence of implicit
bias is especially relevant in settings that are prone to
overload or high stress. These environments include emer-
gency departments or labor and delivery settings, where
relying on automatic or unconscious processes to execute
medical decision making quickly becomes essential. How-
ever, such automatic processes also are likely to activate
stereotypes and unconscious beliefs.8 In addition, cognitive
stressors, such as overcrowding and the demand to care for
more patients during a shift, are associated with an increase in
implicit bias.11

Although the medical profession strives for equal treatment
of all patients, racial disparities in health care are prevalent.6
Racial disparities exist because implicit bias affects health care
providers’ perceptions and decisions, creating inequalities in
access, patient–provider interactions, treatment decisions, and
health outcomes.4,12 Even when health care providers do not
display explicit discrimination, implicit biases still exist.4 A
2012 study found that, after adjusting for medically necessary
procedures, cesarean deliveries were more common among
Black and Latina women than White women. Cesarean deliv-
eries lead to more negative health outcomes for both mother and
baby; research on obstetric care increasingly considers rising
C-section rates to be a source of MMM. Three of the six leading
causes of maternal mortality are associated with cesareans:
hemorrhage, complications of anesthesia, and infection.13

Moreover, many health care providers struggle to ac-
knowledge the impact of personal implicit bias on how they
care for their patients.14 A study conducted by the Society for
Maternal Fetal Medicine showed inconsistency between
clinicians’ willingness to acknowledge disparities in their
practice and their consideration of implicit bias. In fact, 84%

of respondents agreed that disparities affect their practice, but
only 29% believed that personal biases inﬂuenced their
ability to care for patients.8

Furthermore, some health care providers still hold false
beliefs about biological differences between Black and White
individuals that increase implicit bias. These beliefs include
ideas that Black people have less sensitive nerve endings,
thicker skin, and stronger bones.15 The presence of these beliefs
causes health care providers to rate Black patients’ pain lower
and results in less-appropriate treatment recommendations.15
Speciﬁcally regarding pain management, Rust et al. found sig-
niﬁcant racial/ethnic differences in the rates of epidural anal-
gesia. Minorities, speciﬁcally Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic
patients, had signiﬁcantly lower rates of epidural analgesia.16 As
a result, health care provider bias, although unintentional and
often unrecognized, does lead to mistrust in the health care
system and poor patient satisfaction from people of color.17

In a comprehensive report entitled Birth Settings in Amer-
ica: Outcomes, Quality, Access, and Choice by the National
Academies of Sciences, the authors reference the Listening to
Mothers III survey, which found that approximately one in ﬁve
Black and Hispanic women experienced mistreatment from
hospital-based care providers because of their race, ethnicity,
cultural background, and/or language.18 As reported in an ar-
ticle published in 2018, anthropologist Dana-Ain Davis ana-
lyzed the birth stories of Black women living in the United
States. These birth stories describe various forms of mal-
treatment during medical encounters while they were pregnant
or during labor and delivery. Consequently, some women
avoided the hospital if possible and utilized midwives and
doulas for home or birth center services.19

The Effects of Implicit Bias
on Patient–Provider Communication

In addition to its potential impact on medical decision
making, implicit bias also can affect how providers com-
municate with patients. Studies found that people of color are
more likely to report lower satisfaction with health care
provider interactions.7 Subtle racial biases may be expressed
in such ways as approaching patients with a condescending
tone that decreases the likelihood that patients will feel heard
and valued by their providers or recommending different
treatment options for patients based on assumptions about
their treatment adherence capabilities or presumed health
conditions.7 Consistent and robust evidence shows that health
care providers who exhibit higher implicit bias demonstrate
higher verbal dominance in their communication styles and
treatment.11 Subsequently, patients of
less interpersonal
these providers report poorer satisfaction ratings and greater
difﬁculty understanding or
following recommendations,
which can perpetuate biases held by the provider.11 This is a
vicious cycle that highlights the importance of improved
communication and the need for health care providers to be
aware of their own implicit biases.

The actions of providers and their interactions with patients
are highly associated with racial disparities in women’s expe-
rience of trauma during birth. In the United States, 30% of
Black and Hispanic women who delivered in hospitals reported
provider mistreatment, whereas only 21% of White women
reported provider mistreatment.12 The perceived dismissals
women felt of legitimate concerns and symptoms, such as

preeclampsia and hypertension, can help explain the existence
of poor birth outcomes even for Black women with the most
advantages, such as high income and advanced education.20

Opportunities for Intervention

Efforts to resolve racial disparities in maternal health are
constrained by two main challenges: (1) lack of reliable data
on patient identity (including race, ethnicity, native country,
and language) and (2) limited patient and staff education on
the best practices for collecting information related to iden-
tity.8 The improvement of cultural humility programming for
health care providers is increasingly emphasized. Cultural
humility goes beyond cultural competency and is deﬁned as a
life-long commitment to self-evaluation and self-critique in
an effort to address power imbalances and advocate for
others.21 Practicing cultural humility mitigates implicit bias,
promotes empathy, and aids health care providers in ac-
knowledging and respecting patients’ individuality.21 Cul-
tural humility principles emphasize that providers should aim
to connect with patients instead of assuming expertise on the
patient’s race, culture, or ethnicity and how those relate to the
patient’s health.21 Efforts to incorporate awareness of im-
plicit bias in medical and nursing school and residency
training programs are important steps in training the next
generation of health care providers to treat patients and
families with respect and provide high-quality care to an
increasingly diverse patient population.

Evidence also shows that mindfulness interventions are
effective at reducing implicit bias. Mindfulness-based prac-
tices can offer additional beneﬁts to health care providers,
including decreasing burnout and improving empathy and
well-being.11 In one successful intervention, after completing
a baseline IAT and an educational program about the impact of
implicit bias on discriminatory behaviors, participants were
trained on how to apply several bias-reduction strategies to
everyday practice. These strategies included (1) stereotype
replacement, in which individuals were trained to recognize
stereotypes being perpetuated in society and within themselves
and how to replace them with nonstereotypic responses; (2)
counter-stereotypic imaging, in which individuals imagine
someone from a marginalized group who does not fulﬁll
commonly believed stereotypes about that group; (3) indi-
viduation, in which individuals try to get to know someone else
and focus on their individual characteristics, instead of their
group-based characteristics; and (4) perspective taking, in
which individuals consciously assess a situation from the
viewpoint of another racial group. Furthermore, health care
providers should actively seek out as many opportunities for
cross-cultural contact as possible throughout their career.11

As for opportunities regarding patient empowerment, pa-
tients who read their clinical notes through online patient
portals report that doing so engages them actively in their
care, improves their sense of control over their health, and
enhances safety, especially among minority patients.22
Qualitative research also suggests that reading their clinical
notes can help patients feel listened to, validated, and un-
derstood.22 Open notes may increase trust between patients
and clinicians, reduce transmission of biases, and increase
patient engagement. Also, patients should be given infor-
mation to make informed decisions about continuing or
ending a relationship with a provider; expecting mothers are

not obligated to remain with a health care provider
throughout a pregnancy and should be encouraged to ﬁnd the
right ﬁt, particularly early in the pregnancy.19

Additionally, hospital systems can implement mandatory
MMM reviews, which help to identify areas of substandard
care that need improvement.14 If conducting a systematic,
multidisciplinary review of all cases of maternal death and
severe morbidity and establishing a mechanism to dissemi-
nate knowledge gained from those reviews became standard
practice, then hundreds of lives could be saved.

Furthermore, the disparities of any condition, let alone
maternal health, cannot be discussed without also discussing
the system-level factors that may contribute to them. An
important system-level factor that impacts clinical care is the
availability of transportation to in-person visits. Cab vouch-
ers or other transit programs may help with this barrier. The
frequency of scheduled in-person visits poses another chal-
lenge; innovations in telehealth may assist
in improved
patient-centered care. Also, for women who do not speak
English, failures in adequate communication also can con-
tribute to maternal health disparities. Increasing the avail-
ability of interpreter services, both in person and on the
phone, could support improvements in this area.14

Conclusion

To reiterate, most pregnancy-related deaths can be pre-
vented; all levels of the social/ecological model should be
considered together when examining racial disparities in
health care. Further identiﬁcation and evaluation of factors
contributing to racial disparities is crucial to informing and
implementing prevention strategies that will effectively re-
duce disparities in pregnancy-related mortality, including
strategies to improve women’s health and access to quality
care in all maternal phases: preconception, pregnancy, and
postpartum.3 We recognize that addressing this complex
national problem requires coordination and collaboration
among patients, families, health care providers, community
organizations, hospitals, health systems, and policymakers.3
We believe the interdisciplinary work can be done, but in-
dividual implicit bias and the deep impact of structural racism
must be acknowledged and accepted before real progress can
be made in reducing racial disparities in maternal mortality
and decreasing maternal deaths overall in the United States.

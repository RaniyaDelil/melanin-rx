Relative income may be a better predictor of health outcomes than absolute income. We examined two
measures of relative incomedincome incongruity and relative household incomedin relation to preterm
birth in a study of U.S. Black women. Income incongruity is a measure that compares the median
household income of an individual’s residential area with that of others who have the same level of
marital status and education, but who may live in different areas. Relative household income is
a measure that compares an individual’s household income with the median household income of her
residential area. We used data collected biennially (1997–2003) from participants in the Black Women’s
Health Study: 6257 singleton births were included in the income incongruity analyses and 5182 in the
relative household income analyses; 15% of the births were preterm. After adjusting for confounders, we
found no overall association of income incongruity or relative household income with preterm birth. For
relative household income, but not for income incongruity, there was suggestive evidence that neigh-
borhood composition modiﬁed the association with preterm birth: higher relative household income
was associated with higher risk of preterm birth in neighborhoods with a high percentage of Black
residents, and higher relative household income was associated with lower risk in neighborhoods with
a low percentage of Black residents.

Introduction

Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality in the
United States and Blacks are twice as likely as Whites to have
a preterm birth (Ananth, Misra, Demissie, & Smulian, 2001; Ber-
kowitz, Blackmore-Prince, Lapinski, & Savitz, 1998; Green et al.,
2005; Martin et al., 2005). The racial disparity has not been fully
explained by individual-level factors such as history of preterm
birth or lack of prenatal care (Ananth et al., 2001; Berkowitz et al.,
1998; Green et al., 2005). In recent years, researchers have begun to
examine the effects of neighborhood socioeconomic status on
adverse birth outcomes (Ahern, Pickett, Selvin, & Abrams, 2003;
Culhane & Elo, 2005; Farley et al., 2006; Kaufman, Dole, Savitz, &
Herring, 2003; Luo, Wilkins, & Kramer, 2006; Pickett, Ahern, Selvin,
& Abrams, 2002; Pickett & Pearl, 2001).

Economically deprived areas are more likely to be inhabited by
Blacks than Whites, even when both groups have similar income
and education (Krieger, Williams, & Moss, 1997; Massey, Condran, &
Denton, 1987). Economically disadvantaged communities are not as
well-equipped with amenities for good health (e.g. primary care,
supermarkets, and public transportation) as economically advan-
taged areas (Kawachi & Kennedy, 1997; Lynch, Smith, Kaplan, &
House, 2000; Marmot, 2002; Massey et al., 1987; Subramanian &
Kawachi, 2004; Williams & Collins, 2001). Although the socioeco-
nomic status of the individual or the individual’s neighborhood
may affect health, it has been argued that absolute income may not
be as inﬂuential as relative income and social status on morbidity
(Marmot et al., 1991; Singh-Manoux, Adler, & Marmot, 2003) and
mortality (Wilkinson, 1997a, 1997b).

Income incongruity is a measure of relative income originally
developed by Collins et al. (Collins, Herman, & David, 1997). Positive
income incongruity exists when the median household income of
a person’s residential area is greater than that for other individuals
in the entire study population who share the person’s level of
marital status and education, and negative income incongruity
exists when the median household income of a person’s residential

G.S. Phillips et al. / Social Science & Medicine 68 (2009) 2122–2128

2123

area is lower than expected according to the person’s level of
marital status and education (Collins et al., 1997; Pickett, Collins,
Masi, & Wilkinson, 2005). This variable has been used as a marker
for relative income in studies that did not have income data at the
individual level. Two studies, which exclusively enrolled Black
women, have examined positive income incongruity in relation to
preterm birth within levels of census tract racial composition
(Pickett et al., 2005; Vinikoor, Kaufman, Maclehose, & Laraia, 2008).
While no association was observed among Black women who lived
in census tracts of mixed racial composition, positive income
incongruity was associated with a reduced risk of preterm birth
among Black women who resided in predominantly Black census
tracts (Pickett et al., 2005; Vinikoor et al., 2008). Their ﬁnding
supports studies that found beneﬁcial effects of racial residential
segregation on health (Fang, Madhavan, Bosworth, & Alderman,
1998; Halpern, 1993) but contrasts with others that reported
detrimental effects on health (Osypuk & Acevedo-Garcia, 2008;
Williams & Collins, 2001). Another study assessed positive and
negative income incongruity among Black and White women and
found that positive income incongruity, but not negative income
incongruity, was associated with a lower risk of very low birth
weight in both ethnic groups (Collins et al., 1997). The analyses
were not stratiﬁed by neighborhood racial composition.

In the present report from the Black Women’s Health Study, we
had information on individual-level household income as well as
area-level household income. We derived another measure of
relative income,
‘‘relative household income,’’ which deﬁnes an
individual’s household income relative to the household incomes
of others in her residential area (Subramanian & Kawachi, 2004;
Wilkinson, 1997a). To our knowledge, no previous studies have
examined the association of relative household income in relation
to preterm birth. We examined relative household income
(derived from an observed household income) and income
incongruity (derived from an expected household income accord-
ing to marital status and educational level) as potential risk factors
for spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth. We also
examined whether racial composition of the residential area
modiﬁed the effects of these relative income measures on risk of
preterm birth.

study

follow-up

The Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS) is an ongoing
prospective
Black women residing
throughout the United States (Rosenberg, Adams-Campbell, &
Palmer, 1995). In 1995, the study enrolled 59,000 women aged
21–69 years who completed health questionnaires mailed to
subscribers of Essence, a general interest magazine marketed to
Black women. The enrolled population also included family and
friends of early participants and members of selected Black
professional organizations. Participants have been followed
information on
through biennial questionnaires that collect
demographic, reproductive, and medical factors. The study has
maintained an average follow-up rate of 80% since baseline
(Rosenberg, Palmer, Wise, Horton, & Corwin, 2002; Rosenberg,
Wise, & Palmer, 2005).

The 1995 residential addresses were linked to the 2000 U.S.
Census block group data by a company that has been reported to
geocode accurately (Krieger, Waterman, Lemieux, Zierler, & Hogan,
2001). Census block groups are geographic areas typically of
homogenous demographic composition that contain an average of
1500 people (US Census Bureau, 2002).

Income incongruity

Income incongruity compares a participant’s block group
income with the average block group income of others in the study
population with the same marital status and level of education
(Collins et al., 1997; Pickett et al., 2005). To create this variable, we
extracted information on median household income from census
block group data and information on marital status (married or
living as married, and unmarried) and years of education ((cid:2)12, 13–
15, and (cid:3)16 years) from the follow-up questionnaires. Each woman
was classiﬁed as having positive income incongruity if the median
household income of the block group in which she lived was at least
one standard deviation higher (or lower to deﬁne negative income
incongruity) than the average block group median household
income of mothers with the same level of education and marital
status in our study population (Collins et al., 1997; Pickett et al.,
2005). A participant with no income incongruity lived in a block
group with a median household income that was within one
standard deviation of the average block group median household
income for study participants with comparable marital status and
educational level.

Relative household income

Relative household income compares the participant’s house-
hold income to the median household income of the block group in
which she lives. Household income was assessed in categorical
form in the BWHS. We collapsed the census variable, median
household income, into the following six categories of U.S. dollars:
(cid:2)15,000; 15,001–25,000; 25,001–35,000; 35,001–50,000; 50,001–
100,000; and >100,000, and coded them from 1 to 6. This ordinal
variable for block group median household income was then sub-
tracted from the individual-level household income variable, for
which the same categories had also been coded from 1 to 6. We
categorized women as having ‘‘higher relative household income’’
if their individual-level household income was at least one category
higher than their block group’s median household income. We
categorized women as having ‘‘lower relative household income’’ if
their individual-level household income was at least one category
lower than the median household income category of their block
group, while ‘‘similar household income’’ indicated no difference in
categories of individual-level and neighborhood-level household
income.

Preterm birth

On follow-up questionnaires from 1997 to 2003, participants
reported whether they had a singleton birth that was three or
more weeks early, which the BWHS deﬁnes as a preterm birth.
Participants also reported the reason for the preterm birth. We
separately assessed spontaneous preterm births (premature labor
for no known reason or early rupture of membranes) and medi-
cally indicated preterm births (cesarean section or medical
induction) because they may have different etiologies (Berkowitz
et al., 1998; Pickett, Abrams, & Selvin, 2000). The BWHS carried
out two validation studies of self-reported preterm birth (deﬁned
as 3 or more weeks early).
In a study that compared the
self-reports of 25 BWHS participants with medical record data,
preterm birth was conﬁrmed for 23 (92%), and the reason for the
preterm birth was conﬁrmed for 20 of the 23 cases (87%). In
a study that compared the self-reports of 23 BWHS participants
from Massachusetts who delivered singletons during 1995–2003
with birth registry data from the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health, preterm birth was conﬁrmed for 21 out of 23 (91%),
and spontaneous preterm birth was conﬁrmed for 11 of 12

2124

participants (92%). The proportion of preterm birth in the present
analysis, 15.0%, is similar to the proportion among Black women in
national data (based on the <37 weeks gestation deﬁnition) in
2001, 15.6% (Vahratian, Buekens, & Alexander, 2006).

Additional covariates

Maternal age at pregnancy was categorized into ﬁne age groups
(<30, 30–34, 35–39, and (cid:3)40) to minimize residual confounding
from age. Because the minimum age at baseline was 21 and few
women were less than age 25 years at the index birth, we did not
divide the <30 category further. We also considered the following
variables for inclusion in statistical models: years of education
((cid:2)12, 13–15, 16, (cid:3)17), marital status during pregnancy (married or
living as married, divorced/separated/widowed, single), prepreg-
nancy body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (<20, 20–24, 25–29, (cid:3)30)
(WHO Expert Committee, 1995), smoked cigarettes during preg-
nancy (no, yes), parity status (nulliparous, parous), participant born
preterm (no, yes, unsure), had a previous preterm birth (no, yes),
annual household income in U.S. dollars ((cid:2)35,000, 35,001–50,000,
50,001–100,000, >100,000), and number of people supported by
the household income (1, 2, 3, 4, (cid:3)5). The last two factors listed
were assessed on the 2003 questionnaire. The area-level household
income variable was not adjusted for number of people in the
household and, for consistency, we decided against adjusting for
number of people in the household for the individual-level
household income variable in our main analysis. The census vari-
able, percent of Black residents, was divided into three categories:
low, medium, and high, using cut points based on the 25th and 75th
percentiles in our sample: <14.4%, 14.4–82.7%, and >82.7% Black
residents.

Exclusion criteria

From 1997 to 2003, the period during which information on
preterm birth status was collected, 8697 singleton births were
reported by women less than 45 years of age. We restricted our
sample to 7026 ﬁrst reported pregnancies to prevent correlations
arising from two or more births contributed by the same mother. Of
these, 567 were excluded because the mothers had invalid addresses
for geocoding (e.g. business addresses or post ofﬁce boxes). We also
excluded 49 preterm births that could not be classiﬁed as either
spontaneous or medically indicated, leaving 6410 births.

For the income incongruity analyses, we excluded 153 births
because data on the mother’s marital status and education were
missing, leaving data on 6257 births (5312 term births, 499 spon-
taneous preterm births, and 446 medically indicated preterm births).
For the relative household income analysis, we did not exclude
mothers with missing data on maternal education and marital
status because these variables were not used to create the relative
household income variable. Instead, we excluded 1228 mothers
with missing data on family household income from the sample of
6410 participants. This left 5182 births (4408 term births, 402
spontaneous preterm births, and 372 medically indicated preterm
births). The proportion of participants in this sample with (cid:3)16
years of education was 57.3%, compared with 55.2% in the full
sample. Other characteristics such as median maternal age (32 vs.
32 years), median BMI (25.8 vs. 25.9 kg/m2), and proportion of
personal household income > $50,000 (67.9 vs. 68.7%) were also
similar in the two samples.

Statistical analyses

Odds ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals for income incongruity
and relative household income in relation to preterm birth were

estimated using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models.
GEE models were employed using PROC GENMOD in SAS version
9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., 2003) with an empirical variance estimator,
exchangeable working correlation structure, and the ‘‘logit link’’
function. GEE models accounted for the correlation created by two
or more women living in the same block group (Horton & Lipsitz,
1999). In our study, the median number of women per block group
was one (range: 1–12) and the average number of women per block
group was 1.19.

All multivariable models included maternal age, years of
education, marital status, prepregnancy BMI, and smoking during
pregnancy. Indicator terms were added to models for observations
with missing data. Further adjustment for parity, participant born
preterm, previous preterm birth, annual household income, and
number of people supported by the household income yielded little
change in the effect estimates and were not included in ﬁnal
models.

To investigate potential effect modiﬁcation, cross-product terms
between indicator variables of the exposure and the ordinal
percent Black variable were added to statistical models. Wald tests
were used to determine statistical signiﬁcance. Because the BWHS
population is mobile (Russell, Palmer, Adams-Campbell, & Rosen-
berg, 2001), we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine associ-
ations among women who had not moved or who had moved but
had lived during the entire study period in neighborhoods that had
the same category of median household income.

Results

The percentages of mothers with positive and negative income
incongruity were 13.6% and 13.9%, respectively, and the percent-
ages with higher and lower relative household income were 63.0%
and 14.5%. As shown in Table 1, across levels of income incongruity
going from positive to negative, maternal household income and
level of education decreased while body mass index, cigarette
smoking, percent of participants born preterm, having had
a previous preterm birth, and parity increased. For census block
group characteristics across these levels of income incongruity, the
percent of Black residents increased and median household income
decreased. Similar trends in individual-level characteristics were
present across levels of relative household income, going from
higher to lower.

As shown in Table 2, as the percent of Black residents in census
block groups increased, there were decreases in the percent of
married participants, educational level, and household income. The
median household income of block groups decreased as the cate-
gory of percent Black residents increased.

There were no signiﬁcant associations between neighborhood
racial composition,
income incongruity, or relative household
income with preterm birth overall or by preterm birth subtype
(Table 3). There were also no signiﬁcant associations in sensitivity
analyses conﬁned to women whose neighborhood socioeconomic
status had not changed. For the income incongruity sensitivity
analysis (n ¼ 4945 births), the odds ratio was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.73,
1.18) for the association between positive income incongruity and
preterm birth, and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.29) for the association
between negative income incongruity and preterm birth (data not
shown). For the relative household income sensitivity analysis
(n ¼ 4231 births), the odds ratio was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.27) for the
association between higher relative household income and preterm
birth, and 1.18 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.57) for the association between lower
relative household income and preterm birth (data not shown).

After stratifying by neighborhood racial composition (otherwise
referred to as % Black residents in census block groups) (Table 4),
the adjusted odds ratio for positive income incongruity and

preterm birth overall was 1.23 (95% CI: 0.74, 2.05) among women
who lived in block groups with a high percentage of Black residents.
There was a stronger association of positive income incongruity
with spontaneous preterm birth: OR ¼ 1.68, 95% CI: 0.93, 3.06. In
the sensitivity analysis conﬁned to women whose neighborhood
socioeconomic status had not changed, we observed similar results
as those from the full analytic population for census block groups
with a low or medium percentage of Black residents. However, for
those living in block groups with a high percentage of Black resi-
dents we found a stronger association between positive income
incongruity and spontaneous preterm birth (OR ¼ 2.26, 95% CI: 1.17,
4.37) (data not shown). As in the full sample, there was no relation
between negative income incongruity and spontaneous preterm
birth among women who lived in block groups with a high
percentage of Black residents (OR ¼ 1.06, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.92).

For the relative household income analyses stratiﬁed by
neighborhood racial composition (% Black residents) (Table 5),
among participants who resided in block groups with a low
percentage of Black residents, we observed a reduced odds ratio for
preterm birth overall for women with higher relative income
(OR ¼ 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.00) compared with women who were in
the same household income category as those of their block groups.

a high percentage of Black residents, higher relative household
income was associated with an increased odds ratio for preterm
birth overall (OR ¼ 1.80, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.82) and spontaneous
preterm birth (OR ¼ 1.96, 95% CI: 1.07, 3.59). In a sensitivity analysis
conducted among women whose neighborhood socioeconomic
status had not changed, the adjusted odds ratio for the association
between higher relative household income and preterm birth
overall among women who lived in block groups with a high
percentage of Black residents was 2.72 (95% CI: 1.48, 4.98), and the
odds ratio for the association between higher relative income and
preterm birth overall among women living in neighborhoods with
a low percentage of Black residents was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.96),
relative to women with similar household income (data not
shown).

Discussion

In the present study, we examined two different measures of
relative income in relation to preterm birth: one was a comparison
between block groups (i.e. mother’s block group income compared
with the average block group income for women with similar
marital status and education, otherwise called income incongruity)
and the other was a comparison between mother’s household
income and the median income of households in her block group
(i.e. relative household income). Income incongruity depends on
the distribution of the entire study population rather than the
internal characteristics of an area in which the participant lives.
Relative household income directly compares a woman’s income to
that of the households in the areas in which she resides. Studying
relative household income could improve our understanding of
how socioeconomic inequalities within residential communities
may affect health.

Our results suggest that income incongruity is not associated
with preterm birth and that neighborhood racial composition
(percent of Black residents) does not modify the relation between
income incongruity and preterm birth. While we also found no
overall association of relative household income with preterm
birth, there was some evidence of a positive association between
relative household income and spontaneous preterm birth in
analyses stratiﬁed by neighborhood racial composition, although
neighborhood composition itself was not associated with preterm
birth. Odds ratios for both higher and lower relative household
incomes in relation to preterm birth were below one in areas with
low percentages of Black residents and above one in areas with
high percentages of Black residents. The different associations in

areas with high and low proportions of Black residents, if real, may
be explained by different pathways. One might speculate that in
predominantly Black areas, mothers with lower household incomes
may have had less ﬁnancial ability to use available resources
important for good health (Massey et al., 1987). The positive asso-
ciation seen among mothers with higher household incomes who
lived in predominantly Black areas could be related to the stresses
associated with living in economically disadvantaged areas (Mor-
land, Wing, Diez Roux, & Poole, 2002), coupled with feelings of
isolation or lack of social support that women with household
incomes similar to the median household income in their block
groups may not experience. Acute and chronic stress have been
associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth
(Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring
Healthy Outcomes & Board on Health Sciences Policy, 2007; Holz-
man, Jetton, Siler-Khodr, Fisher, & Rip, 2001; McLean & Smith,
2001; Moawad et al., 2002). This could explain why the estimated
effect of relative household income among those who resided in
predominantly Black block groups was stronger for spontaneous
preterm birth than for medically indicated preterm birth. Among

participants who lived in block groups with a low proportion of
Black residents, mothers with higher relative household income
had a reduced risk of preterm birth overall. If real, an explanation
might be that women with higher household incomes had better
ﬁnancial means to afford good health promoting amenities and
services available within these communities. To our knowledge
there have been no other studies of relative income in relation to
preterm birth.

Our income incongruity results do not conﬁrm previously
reported protective effects of positive incongruity in relation to
adverse pregnancy outcomes (Collins et al., 1997; Pickett et al.,
2005; Vinikoor et al., 2008). Collins et al. (1997) found an inverse
association between positive income incongruity and very low
birth weight among Blacks (OR ¼ 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5, 0.9) and Whites
(OR ¼ 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5, 0.9). They found no association with negative
income incongruity and did not stratify by racial composition.
Pickett et al. (2005) and Vinikoor et al. (2008) examined positive
income incongruity and stratiﬁed by two levels of racial density. No
association was observed among women who resided in racially
mixed census tracts in either study. The odds ratio among women

who lived in ‘‘predominantly Black’’ census tracts in the Pickett
study was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.92), and the odds ratio in the Vin-
ikoor study was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.92) among mothers who lived
in census tracts with ‘‘high relative density’’ of African Americans.
Our study has a number of strengths. We assessed spontaneous
preterm birth and medically indicated preterm birth separately as
well as combined. Our income incongruity variable, which is based
on three categories of education in contrast to the two levels used
in previous studies, allowed for a more detailed assessment of
income incongruity. We assessed a new measure of relative income,
relative household income. Effect estimates were examined not
only among women who resided in predominantly Black areas but
also among women who lived in areas with a low proportion of
Black residents. We adjusted for multiple confounders including
some not controlled in previous studies, such as prepregnancy body
mass index and cigarette smoking.

Our study has several

limitations. Preterm birth was self-
reported and not based on clinical assessment. However, validation
studies showed an acceptable level of accuracy in reporting, and the
prevalence of preterm birth was comparable to the prevalence
based on national data (Vahratian et al., 2006). Maternal household
income was assessed on the 2003 questionnaire only and was used
as an estimate of maternal household income around the time of
pregnancy, which could have been up to 6 years earlier. In addition,
19% of the mothers had missing information on household income
and could not be included in the relative household income anal-
yses. However, maternal characteristics for participants in this
analytic sample were similar to those in the full sample of partic-
ipants with data on household income. Since the BWHS is a mobile
population and census data were linked to 1995 residential
addresses, there would have been misclassiﬁcation in the measures
of neighborhood income if a mother lived in a census block group in
1995 that was economically different from that at the time of her
pregnancy. However, associations from sensitivity analyses carried
out among women whose neighborhood socioeconomic status had
not changed during the study period were similar or stronger than
those in the overall analysis, suggesting that such misclassiﬁcation
is not an explanation for our ﬁndings.

The BWHS is a convenience sample of U.S. Black women and
participants in the BWHS may have differed in some respects from
other Black women who did not participate. Almost all BWHS
participants (97%) have obtained at least a high school degree and
83% of U.S. Black women nationally of similar ages have acquired

the same level of education (US Bureau of the Census, August 1996).
Therefore, assuming internal validity, the results on the effects of
relative income may be applicable to many Black women nation-
ally, except for perhaps the 17% who have not completed high
school.

inverse associations of

In conclusion, while absolute income is signiﬁcantly associ-
ated with risk of preterm birth in the United States, particularly
at the area-level (Ahern et al., 2003; Farley et al., 2006; Kaufman
et al., 2003; Pickett et al., 2002), it is unclear whether relative
income is also a strong determinant. The evidence from studies
to date is mixed and conclusions about an effect of relative
income would be premature. We did not conﬁrm previous
ﬁndings of
income incongruity with
preterm birth among Black women overall (Collins et al., 1997)
or among Black women who lived in neighborhoods with a high
percentage of Black residents (Pickett et al., 2005; Vinikoor et al.,
2008). However, we did ﬁnd associations between relative
household income and preterm birth within levels of neigh-
borhood racial composition. These ﬁndings suggest that context
may be an important determinant of whether relative income
inﬂuences risk of preterm birth. Further studies might consider
focusing on potential modiﬁers, such as neighborhood racial
composition, of an association between relative income and
birth outcomes.

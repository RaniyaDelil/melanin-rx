Onset of Natural Menopause in African American Women

| Julie R. Palmer, ScD, Lynn Rosenberg, ScD, Lauren A. Wise, MSc, Nicholas J. Horton, ScD, Lucile L. Adams-Campbell, PhD

A woman’s age at the onset of natural meno-
pause is associated with several serious ill-
nesses. For example, early menopause has
been associated with an increased risk of os-
teoporosis1,2 and with an increased overall
mortality.3,4 Cigarette smoking is the only
factor that has been consistently linked to
earlier natural menopause.5–13 Nullipar-
ity,12,14–16 nonuse of oral contraceptives,12,16–18
low body mass index,10,19 and low educa-
tional status12,16,20 have also been associated
with earlier menopause, but the evidence is
inconsistent.

Almost all available data on determinants

of age at natural menopause in American
women have come from studies of White
women. The exceptions are Bromberger et
al.’s6 prospective study of age at natural men-
opause, which included 19 Black women and
Gold et al.’s12 cross-sectional study of natural
menopause, which included 4157 African
American women. One of the findings of the
Bromberger study was an association be-
tween increased stress and an earlier age of
menopause among the Black women. In our
report, we prospectively assessed the relation
of demographic, reproductive, and health fac-
tors to age at natural menopause among US
Black women, based on data from a follow-up
study of 64 500 African American women.
To pursue a hypothesis raised by the study of
Bromberger et al.,6 we also assessed the rela-
tion of participants’ perceived experiences of
racism to the risk of early menopause.

METHODS

Data Collection

In 1995, 64 500 US Black women aged
21 to 69 years from all areas of the United
States enrolled in the Black Women’s Health
Study by completing health question-
naires.21–24 The questionnaires were mailed
to subscribers to Essence magazine, members
of selected Black professional organizations,
and friends and relatives of early respon-
dents. The participants were sent follow-up

Objectives. This study assessed predictors of the onset of natural menopause in Af-

rican American women.

Methods. We used mailed questionnaires to collect data at baseline in 1995 and dur-
ing follow-up from Black Women’s Health Study participants. Cox proportional hazards
regression was used to assess potential predictors—including experiences of racism—
of the onset of natural menopause among 17 070 women aged 35 to 55 years and pre-
menopausal in 1995.

Results. The hazard ratio (HR) was 1.43 for current smokers (95% confidence inter-
val [CI]=1.24, 1.66) and 1.21 (95% CI=1.06, 1.38) for ex-smokers and significantly less
for obese women and oral contraceptive users. Hazard ratios for most questions about
racism were elevated by 10% to 30% but were not statistically significant.

Conclusions. Earlier onset of natural menopause among African American women is
strongly associated with smoking and inversely associated with body mass index and
oral contraceptive use. (Am J Public Health. 2003;93:299–306)

questionnaires in 1997 and 1999: 82% com-
pleted the 1997 questionnaire and 80% com-
pleted the 1999 questionnaire.

The 1995 questionnaire asked about many

factors, including current weight and height,
history of oral contraceptive use, vigorous
physical activity in the previous year, current
and past cigarette smoking, parity, and age at
menarche. With respect to menopause, the
women were asked in 1995: “Have your
menstrual periods stopped permanently (yes/
yes but have periods now due to female hor-
mones/ no/ not sure).” The 1997 question-
naire asked: “Have you gone through meno-
pause (yes/ yes but have periods now due to
female hormones/ no but I am currently
going through menopause/ no/ uncertain); If
yes (gone through menopause), what was the
age at menopause and what caused the men-
opause (natural menopause/ surgery/ med-
ication, chemotherapy, radiation).” The 1999
questionnaire asked: “Have your menstrual
periods stopped permanently (menopause)
(yes/ yes but have periods now due to female
hormones/ no/ uncertain/ never had peri-
ods).” If periods had ceased permanently, the
women were asked the age at which their pe-
riods stopped and the reason (natural meno-
pause/ surgery/ medications, chemotherapy,
radiation). The 1997 questionnaire also asked
questions about perceptions of experiences of
racism. There were 5 questions about experi-

ences in daily life: “In your day-to-day life,
how often has it happened that you received
poorer service than other people in restau-
rants or stores; people acted as if they
thought you were not intelligent; people acted
as if they were afraid of you; people acted as
if they thought you were dishonest; people
acted as if they were better than you.” There
were 3 questions about unfair treatment:
“Have you ever been treated unfairly due to
your race in the area of: job (hiring, promo-
tion, firing); housing (renting, buying, mort-
gage); police (stopped, searched, threatened).”
These were taken from a set of questions
used by Williams et al.25 in a study of racial
differences in physical and mental health; a
high score was positively related to several
measures of poor health in that study. Finally,
participants were asked how often they
thought about their race, with a question de-
veloped by C. Jones.26

In our study, menopause was defined as
permanent cessation of menstrual periods. To
assess the degree of misclassification of natu-
ral menopause, we examined the 1999 ques-
tionnaire responses of the 253 women who
reported a natural menopause on the 1997
questionnaire. Of these, 224 had completed
the menopause section of the 1999 question-
naire; 88% reported having had a natural
menopause, suggesting that misclassification
of age at menopause was not substantial. The

baseline: parity (nulliparous, 1, 2, 3, ≥ 4
births), age at menarche (<11, 11, 12–13,
14, ≥15 years), years of oral contraceptive
use (never use, 1–4, 5–9, ≥10 years), unilat-
eral oophorectomy, smoking status (never,
past, current), years of education (<12, 12,
13–15, 16, ≥17), vigorous physical activity
(none, < 5 hours per week, ≥ 5 hours per
week), and body mass index (in kilograms
per meter2) (< 20, 20–24, 25–29, ≥ 30).
Women with missing information on any co-
variate (n = 760) were dropped from the
final analysis. We also assessed the estimated
number of ovulatory cycles, defined as fol-
lows: [(age at baseline – age at menarche) –
(parity + years of oral contraceptive use)] ÷
(average cycle length/365); we did not have
information on cycle length and used 28 for
the average cycle length in the formula.29
The assumption of proportional hazards
was evaluated for the final model by plotting
the complementary log-log transform and as-
sessing parallelism of the exposure-specific
survival curves.28 To address the possibility
that hormone replacement therapy may be
related to the onset of menopausal symptoms
and may differ by socioeconomic position,30
we conducted separate analyses28,31 in which
the 724 women who initiated hormone re-
placement use before menopause were reclas-
sified as having had the outcome event. We
also ran models in which premenopausal
women who used oral contraceptives (n =
922) were considered premenopausal
throughout the follow-up period rather than
being censored. Because these analyses
yielded results similar to those with the origi-
nal outcome definition, we present data only
from the original analysis.

RESULTS

Baseline demographic, lifestyle, and health
characteristics of the 17 070 participants who
were premenopausal at the start of follow-up
are presented in Table 1 according to their
menstrual status at the end of follow-up. In
total, 1323 women reached a natural meno-
pause (reported by 253 women on the 1997
questionnaire and by 1070 on the 1999
questionnaire) and 12 796 women were still
premenopausal at the end of follow-up. The
remainder underwent either surgical meno-

remaining 12% indicated that they were cur-
rently “going through menopause” or were
“uncertain” about their menopausal status;
these women were not considered to have
undergone natural menopause. It was not
possible to perform similar data cleaning for
women who first reported the occurrence of
natural menopause on the 1999 question-
naire because subsequent data on their men-
opausal status were not available, but there is
no reason to expect different results.

Data Analysis

Our analytic sample comprised all Black
Women’s Health Study participants who were
premenopausal and aged 35 to 55 years at
baseline (1995) and who had completed at
least 1 follow-up questionnaire (1997 or
1999) (n = 17 070). Our analytic goal was to
estimate the incidence of menopause in rela-
tion to selected baseline characteristics and
perceived experiences of racism. All women
were considered “at risk” for menopause until
the occurrence of natural menopause, the end
of their follow-up period in the study (maxi-
mum of 4 years), or the occurrence of a cen-
soring event. Women were censored at the
midpoint of the follow-up interval in which
they reported hysterectomy (n = 670), bilat-
eral oophorectomy (n = 553), medical meno-
pause (n = 82), or use of hormone replace-
ment therapy or oral contraceptives (n =
1646).

Proportional hazards regression models
were used to derive hazard ratios (HRs) for
age at natural menopause in relation to se-
lected baseline characteristics and perceived
experiences of racism, with adjustment for po-
tential confounders.27 The hazard function for
each variable was related to the conditional
probability of reaching menopause at age t,
given that a woman had not reached meno-
pause by age t. We used the PHREG proce-
dure in SAS (version 8.0; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC), with the “exact” option to handle
ties, as age was measured to the nearest
year.28

We assessed factors that, on theoretical

grounds, may be associated with natural
menopause or that have been shown to be
associated with natural menopause in previ-
ous studies. Our final multivariate model in-
cluded the following covariates measured at

pause or medical menopause, or began tak-
ing hormones before the permanent cessa-
tion of menses. The mean age at natural
menopause was 49.6 years (SD = 3.71); the
median age was 50 years (interquartile
range = 47, 52).

Hazard ratios are given in Table 2 as esti-

mates of the incidence rate ratios for these
factors in relation to the occurrence of natural
menopause. Cigarette smoking was most
strongly associated with early menopause: the
hazard ratio was 1.43 (95% confidence inter-
val [CI] = 1.24, 1.66) for current smokers and
1.21 (95% CI = 1.06, 1.38) for past smokers
relative to never smokers. A dose response–
relation with the duration and intensity of cig-
arette smoking was found, with the hazard
ratio for pack-years of smoking increasing to
1.52 (95% CI = 1.30, 1.79) for the highest
quartile (P for trend = .0048). High body
mass index was associated with a reduced oc-
currence of menopause: the hazard ratio for
women in the highest category, ≥ 30, was
0.78 (95% CI = 0.67, 0.90) relative to
women with a body mass index of 20 to 24
years. The hazard ratio was also reduced for
women who had used oral contraceptives for
at least 1 year relative to women who used
them for shorter periods or not at all (0.86
[95% CI = 0.77, 0.96]), but there was no fur-
ther reduction associated with longer-term
use. The hazard ratio for parous women rela-
tive to nulliparous women was 0.93, but the
confidence interval included 1.0, and there
was no trend by the number of births. The
hazard ratio for unilateral oophorectomy was
1.17 (95% CI = 0.82, 1.66). Age at menarche,
years of education, and vigorous physical ac-
tivity were not related to the occurrence of
menopause. The number of lifetime ovulatory
cycles also was not associated with meno-
pause (HR for ≥ 300 cycles relative to < 300
was 1.03 [95% CI = 0.87, 1.24]).

The analyses were repeated separately ac-
cording to age at the start of follow-up, 35 to
44 or 45 to 55 years, with the former pro-
viding information on very early menopause.
Unilateral oophorectomy was strongly associ-
ated with age at menopause among the youn-
ger women (HR = 2.00 [95% CI = 1.09,
3.68]), but not among the older women
(HR = 0.87 [95% CI = 0.54, 1.39]). Cigarette
smoking, body mass index, and oral contra-

questions about experiencing discrimination
in the areas of employment, housing, or the
police were all close to 1.0. For the question
on how often the participant thinks about her
race, the hazard ratio for the category “once a
day” was significantly elevated (1.23 [95%
CI = 1.02, 1.47]), but the estimate for the
highest category (“constantly”) was only
slightly elevated (1.05 [95% CI = .87, 1.27]).
For all 9 questions concerning race and rac-
ism, the hazard ratio was elevated for the
missing category. A comparison of women
who did not answer 1 or more of the racism
questions with those who answered all of the
questions indicated that these groups were
similar with respect to most of the study vari-
ables but had fewer years of education. We
repeated the analyses of racism questions
within subgroups defined according to age
and educational status and found no evidence
of interaction.

The questions on racism were asked at the
first follow-up, in 1997. We assumed that re-
sponses to those questions represented the in-
dividual’s general experiences of racism
rather than experiences at 1 particular time,
and therefore we considered these variables
to be “baseline” characteristics of the partici-
pants. To check this assumption, we repeated
our analyses, beginning follow-up in 1997
rather than 1995, and found the results to be
unchanged.

DISCUSSION

The median age at menopause in this
study falls in the range of values reported in
follow-up studies of White women.10,32 In the
small study by Bromberger et al.,6 the median
age at menopause in Black women was 49.3
years.

The permanent cessation of menstrual pe-
riods is thought to be due to the depletion of
ovarian follicles.33 Follicles are depleted by
ovulation and by atresia or degeneration. Pre-
vious studies indicate that current cigarette
smoking leads to an earlier age at meno-
pause5–13; results on past smoking are
mixed.10,12,13 One possible mechanism is that
tobacco smoke constituents such as polycyclic
hydrocarbons may destroy primordial oocytes
or may contribute to degeneration of follicles

through lowered estrogen levels.34–36 Our re-
sults suggest that both current and past smok-
ing result in an earlier menopause among US
Black women. The effect was stronger for
current smokers and was greatest for women
who had the heaviest exposure to cigarette
smoke, as estimated by total pack-years of
smoking.

Factors related to the lifetime number of
ovulatory cycles, and therefore possibly to
age at menopause, include age at menarche,
parity, and oral contraceptive use. We found
no relation between age at menarche and
age at menopause, in agreement with most
previous studies on the topic.14,16 A number
of studies have indicated that nulliparous
women and oral contraceptive users have an
earlier menopause,12,14–16 and some have
suggested that age at menopause increases
with increasing parity.15 We did not find an
association with number of births and ob-
served only a weak (nonsignificant) associa-
tion with nulliparity. The use of oral contra-
ceptives for 1 year or longer was associated
with a later age at menopause, although we
did not find a stronger association for long-
term users. Cramer and Xu29 suggested that
a measure of the lifetime number of ovula-
tory cycles may be a good predictor of age
at menopause. We found no association be-
tween the number of ovulatory cycles and
age at menopause. However, this measure
was imprecise because we did not have in-
formation on the participants’ usual cycle
length, which may contribute much of the
variation in the number of lifetime ovulatory
cycles.

Another reproductive variable, a history of

unilateral oophorectomy without hysterec-
tomy, has been linked with an early age at
menopause in 2 previous studies.15,37 Such
surgical procedures deplete a woman’s ovar-
ian follicles and may predispose to a hypo-
estrogenic state. In our study, there was little
association between unilateral oophorectomy
and age at menopause overall, but a strong
association among the younger women. The
study by Cramer et al.37 was also a study of
very early menopause—the average age at
menopause was 42.2 years

Obese women had a reduced occurrence
of early menopause in our study. Obesity has
been associated with inadequate ovarian

sectional study that assessed natural meno-
pause in Black women.12 As in other studies
of age at menopause, the analyses were
based on self-reports; random misclassifica-
tion would have tended to weaken associa-
tions. Previous US studies have indicated a
high degree of accuracy in the self-reporting
of hysterectomy and oophorectomy.48,49 The
usual definition of menopause is permanent
cessation of menstrual periods, indicated by a
lack of menstruation for at least 12 months.
In our study, permanent cessation of periods
was self-defined. To assess the degree of mis-
classification, we checked 1999 question-
naire responses for women who reported per-
manent cessation of menstruation due to
natural causes on the 1997 questionnaire:
the concordance was 88%, suggesting that
misclassification of age at menopause was not
substantial.

The vast majority of participants in the
present study had completed high school or a
higher level of education. Thus the study re-
sults are likely generalizable to the 85% of
US Black women of the same ages who have
at least a high school education.50 We cannot
determine whether any of the factors under
study, including racism, have a different rela-
tion to age at menopause among low-income
Black women.

In summary, the present data from the
Black Women’s Health Study indicate that the
factor most strongly associated with age at
menopause in Black women is smoking, in
agreement with findings in White women.
The results also suggest that young women
who have a unilateral oophorectomy without
hysterectomy are at increased risk of early
menopause. The study provides equivocal
data on whether experiences of racism accel-
erate the onset of menopause.

addition, the production of estrone in the adi-
pose tissue of obese women may result in
higher estrogen levels, which may lead to less
follicular degeneration. Some previous studies
found an earlier age at menopause among
women with a low body mass index,10,19 but
others did not.8,12,13,20

A prospective study of the determinants of
age at menopause in 185 healthy US women
found an earlier age at menopause for the
African American women (n = 19) and also
found that psychosocial stress was predictive
of an earlier menopause among those
women.6 In another study, by Harlow et
al.,39 depression was associated with earlier
menopause. It appears that stress activates
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, lead-
ing to increased secretion of glucocorticoids
with inhibition of release of gonadotropin-
releasing hormone and suppression of ovula-
tion.40,41 This mechanism is thought to ex-
plain the well-established link between stress
and hypothalamic amenorrhea.42,43 However,
it is not clear how this pathway would lead to
an earlier menopause. Racism can act as a
chronic stressor, and in recent years there
has been increasing interest in the potential
health effects of daily life experiences of rac-
ism.44–47 In our study, participants answered
9 questions related to experiences of racism;
statistically significant associations were ob-
served for 2. These could be chance associa-
tions given the number of possible outcomes
for these questions and the lack of a “dose–
response relation.” However, the hazard ra-
tios for most categories of response for the
questions were over 1.0. The largest and
most consistent associations with the occur-
rence of menopause were for categories of
missing response. Further research is needed
to explore whether not answering sensitive
questions like these may in some way be a
marker for the experience of racism.

The data in our study were collected pro-
spectively, minimizing the potential for recall
bias and uncertainty about the timing of fac-
tors of interest in relation to the occurrence
of menopause. The sample is much larger
than that in only previous study to assess age
at menopause prospectively in US Black
women6 and larger than that in a cross-

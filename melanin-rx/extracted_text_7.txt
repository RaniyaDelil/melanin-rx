Abstract

Objective—We examined the risk of preterm birth in relation to prepregnancy BMI (kg/m2),
waist circumference, adult weight gain, and gestational weight gain among African-American
women.

Methods—Using prospective data from the Black Women's Health Study, we assessed the
association between maternal anthropometric factors and preterm birth among 7,841 singletons
born to women ages 21–44 in 1995–2003. We compared mothers of infants born three or more
weeks early (597 spontaneous preterm births (SPTB); 517 medically-indicated preterm births
(MPTB)) with mothers of 6,727 term infants. We used generalized estimating equation models to
derive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for potential confounders.

Results—Women with prepregnancy BMI <18 were at increased risk of SPTB and MPTB
relative to normal weight women (BMI 20–24), and obese women (BMI ≥30) were at increased
risk of MPTB. There were modest positive associations between waist circumference, a measure
of central adiposity, and both preterm birth subtypes. Adult weight gain was also positively related
to both preterm birth subtypes. Associations with SPTB were generally stronger for gestations of
<32 weeks. Low gestational weight gain (<0.5 lbs/week) was associated with an increased risk of
SPTB among normal weight and obese women. High gestational weight gain (≥1.5 lbs/week) was
associated with increased risk of SPTB among overweight (BMI 25–29) and obese women.

Conclusion—Our data suggest that prepregnancy adiposity (overall and central), prepregnancy
weight gain, and gestational weight gain influence risk of preterm birth among African-American
women.

Introduction

Preterm birth is two times more common among Black women than White women1–3 and is
a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the U.S.1, 4, 5 In 2006, preterm birth
accounted for 12.8% of all births in the U.S. and its prevalence has been on the rise among
single and multiple gestations.1 The ethnic disparity in preterm birth is not fully explained
by established risk factors such as personal history of preterm birth, intrauterine infections,
and low socioeconomic status.6

The prevalence of overweight and obesity has been increasing in the U.S., especially among
Black women of childbearing age.7, 8 High body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), a measure of
absolute body fat,9 is associated with markers of systemic inflammation (e.g., c-reactive
protein),10–12 dyslipidemia,10, 13 and hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance,14 all of which
are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. These findings suggest that obesity-
related metabolic and endothelial disturbances could influence risk of preterm birth via
several pathways.15 In addition, maternal obesity is positively associated with urogenital and
intrauterine infections, which are thought to be a leading cause of preterm birth.16 On the
other hand, obesity is inversely associated with short cervix,17, 18 another risk factor for
preterm birth.

The obesity epidemic observed in recent decades has paralleled the increase in preterm birth
rates. An unanswered question is whether obesity explains part of the increase in preterm
birth. The literature on obesity in relation to preterm birth is mixed. While some studies have
reported a positive association between overweight or obesity and preterm birth,19–23 others
found no association24–31 or an inverse association.32–35 Most,19, 20, 22, 23, 36, 37 but not all32
studies, found a positive association between obesity and preterm birth at very early
gestational ages (e.g., ≤32 weeks); two of the studies found a positive association among
nulliparous women only.22, 23 In the studies that examined preterm birth subtypes
separately,17, 21, 33, 38, 39 obesity was consistently associated with an increased risk of
medically-indicated preterm birth17, 21, 33, 38, 39 but its influence on spontaneous preterm
birth was unclear, with studies reporting no association,38, 39 an inverse association17, 33 and
a positive association (for preterm premature rupture of membranes only).21

To our knowledge, no studies have examined whether adult weight gain, a correlate of
systemic inflammation,40 increases preterm birth risk. Likewise, the relation of central
adiposity to preterm birth has not been explored. Central adiposity, the distribution of excess
fat in the upper trunk region, is often measured by waist circumference and is associated
with hormonal and metabolic changes, including altered estrogen metabolism, insulin
resistance, and hyperinsulinemia.41–43 Central obesity is more common in Black women
than White women.44

Finally, there is conflicting evidence about the joint association of maternal weight gain
during mid- to late- gestation and obesity with preterm birth: studies have reported both
decreased36–38 and increased31 risks of preterm birth associated with low gestational weight
gain among obese women. In addition, experts disagree as to whether the current Institute of
Medicine guidelines for gestational weight gain45 are appropriate for Black women,46 with
some arguing that Black women should strive for weight gain towards the upper end of the
ranges recommended for white women of similar prepregnancy BMI to reduce risk of low
birth weight.45 Although smaller studies of prepregnancy body weight and adverse
pregnancy outcomes have included Black women,27, 37 only one stratified by race/
ethnicity.27

Using data from the Black Women's Health Study, a U.S. prospective cohort study of
approximately 59,000 Black women, we assessed the relation of selected anthropometric
variables measured before pregnancy – BMI, waist circumference, and adult weight gain –
with risk of spontaneous and medically-indicated preterm birth. We also examined the role
of weight gain during pregnancy on risk of these preterm birth subtypes.

Materials and Methods

Study population

The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) is an ongoing national prospective cohort study
of 59,000 African-American women aged 21 to 69 at baseline (1995).47 Women were
enrolled in 1995 through questionnaires mailed to subscribers of Essence magazine,
members of Black professional organizations, and friends and relatives of respondents. The
baseline questionnaire elicited information on demographic and behavioral characteristics,
reproductive and contraceptive histories, anthropometric factors, health care utilization, and
medical history. BWHS respondents live in various states across the country, with the
majority residing in California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Georgia, and New Jersey. The
study is approved by the Institutional Review Board at Boston University Medical Center.

Every two years, participants are mailed a follow-up questionnaire to update their health
information; follow-up through 2007 has exceeded 80%. We have compared respondents to
nonrespondents for various cycles in order to assess whether there are selective losses. In
2001, for example, respondents were older than non-respondents (mean age: 39.2 vs. 37.2)
and had slightly higher education levels (14.9 vs. 14.5 years), but were similar in every other
factor assessed (e.g., BMI ≥30, 30% vs. 31%; parity ≥3, 20% vs. 20%).

Assessment of pregnancy outcomes

We identified all women who reported a preterm birth during 1995–2003. On the 1997,
1999, 2001, and 2003 questionnaires, women were asked whether they had given birth to a
live or still born child in the previous two years. For singleton live or still births, women
were asked “did the doctor say this child was born at least 3 weeks early?” and, if yes, how
early (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or ≥10 weeks), and whether the birth was early due to preterm labor
for no known reason or early rupture of membranes (spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB)) or
medically-indicated labor or cesarean section (medically-indicated preterm birth (MPTB)).
Due dates and birth dates were also elicited for a more precise estimate of gestational age.

Validation of pregnancy outcomes

Clinically, preterm birth is defined as a birth occurring <37 weeks of gestation from the date
of the last menstrual period.48 In the BWHS, we defined preterm birth as a birth occurring
“three or more weeks early.” The proportion of preterm birth in our sample (15.2%) is
similar to the proportion in national data for Black babies born <37 weeks of gestation
(15.6%).48 In a validation study carried out using registry data from the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health, 21 of 23 (91.3%) BWHS participants from Massachusetts who
reported a singleton preterm delivery during 1995–2003 had gestations ≤37 weeks
documented by the registry (we prioritized the LMP estimate of gestational age, unless the
clinical estimate was earlier). Moreover, 11 out of 12 reports of spontaneous preterm birth
were corroborated by registry data. Finally, the distribution of birth weight among preterm
births in the BWHS (birth weight from registry data: mean=2,320g,median=2,495g,
interquartile range: 1,875g–2,778g) closely matches national data on Black babies,48
suggesting that our definition of preterm birth is consistent with the clinical definition.

Assessment of maternal anthropometric factors

In 1995, BWHS participants reported their height (feet and inches), current weight (pounds),
weight at age 18 (pounds), waist circumference (inches) at the level of the umbilicus, and
hip circumference (inches) at its widest location. Current weight was updated every two
years by questionnaire. Adult weight gain was defined as the difference between current
weight and weight at age 18 (kg). We used body mass index (BMI = weight (kg) divided by
height squared (m2)) to measure overall obesity and waist circumference to estimate total

abdominal fat.49 Although waist-to-hip ratio is used more widely in the medical literature,
waist circumference provides an estimate of absolute abdominal adiposity, the component
most correlated with metabolic abnormalities such as hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and
high triglyceride levels.49 Weight and BMI data were derived from the questionnaire prior to
the questionnaire on which a woman reported the birth. (If the woman was currently
pregnant at that time, data were taken from an earlier questionnaire.) Women were asked
about their pregnancy weight gain using the following categories: <10, 10–14, 15–19, 20–
24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, >39 pounds.

We used a gestational weight gain formula developed by Dietz et al.37 that accounts for
expected weight gain per trimester and gestational age. Given that the rate of weight gain is
typically low in the first trimester and is higher and linear in the second and third
trimesters,45, 50assuming a constant rate of weight gain across trimesters would create an
upward bias because women with shorter gestation would be misclassified as having lower
weight gain. Therefore, in accordance with Dietz et al.,37 we estimated weight gain during
the second and third trimesters by subtracting an expected average weight gain during the
first trimester from total gestational weight gain and then dividing by gestational weeks
minus 14 weeks. First-trimester weight gain was based on Institute of Medicine data,45
which estimates an average weight gain of 5 lbs for underweight women, 3.5 lbs for normal-
weight women, and 2 lbs for overweight, obese, or very obese women.

Validation of anthropometric measures

In 2001, we conducted a validation study of anthropometric measures among 115 BWHS
participants from the Washington D.C. area. The Spearman correlation between self-
reported (mean=176 lbs) and technician-measured weight (mean=181 lbs) was 0.97. The
correlation between self-reported (mean=64.4 inches) and technician-measured height
(mean=64.0 inches) was 0.93. The correlation for self-reported versus technician-measured
waist circumference was 0.75.

For gestational weight gain assessed in categories, the weighted kappa statistic was 0.55 for
the comparison of self-reported vs. registry-supplied data from the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health birth registry. When we converted the categorical BWHS
gestational weight gain variable into a continuous variable using the midpoint of each
category, and assigning 5 lbs. to the lowest category and 40 lbs. to the highest, the Spearman
correlation coefficient was 0.56.

Assessment of covariates

Data on participant's age at delivery, state of residence, gravidity (number of pregnancies),
parity (number of births), smoking before and during pregnancy, previous preterm birth,
participant born preterm, and maternal medical conditions (pregestational or gestational
diabetes; pre-gestational or gestational hypertension; or thyroid conditions) were obtained
on the baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Information on education was elicited in 1995
and marital status was elicited in 1995, 1997, and 1999.

Exclusions

Analyses were restricted to mothers ages 21–44 years who reported singleton births during
1995–2003 (N=8,718). Women who reported that they were currently pregnant at the time
of the 1995 questionnaire (N=685) were excluded because their anthropometric
measurements could have been influenced by pregnancy weight gain. Women with missing
BMI data were also excluded (N=96). We examined spontaneous and medically-indicated
preterm births separately because they are thought to have different etiologies. Women
reporting preterm births without sufficient data to be classified with respect to preterm birth

BMI categories were based on World Health Organization standards,51 with added cut
points at the extremes. Obesity is defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2. We categorized waist
circumference into quintiles and adult weight gain into 10-kilogram increments. We
categorized gestational weight gain as low (<0.5 lbs/week), average (0.5–1.4 lbs/week), and
high (≥1.5 lbs/week) based on the Institute of Medicine's recommendation that women of
average prepregnancy BMI gain 1 lb/week during the second and third trimesters.37, 45

Generalized estimating equation models52 were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for the association between selected anthropometric factors (BMI,
adult weight gain, waist circumference, and gestational weight gain) and each preterm birth
subtype. These models account for any correlation resulting from the contribution of more
than one birth per women (1,452 women contributed more than 1 birth to the analysis).
Multivariable models were adjusted for time period (i.e., questionnaire cycle) and known or
suspected risk factors for preterm birth, including maternal age at delivery, parity, years of
education, marital status, smoking during pregnancy, previous preterm birth, and participant
born preterm. Full multivariable models simultaneously controlled for BMI and waist
circumference to assess their independent effects.

The analyses for SPTB were repeated using more stringent cut points for gestational age.
Since the effect of obesity on pregnancy outcomes may operate through pre-gestational
diabetes and hypertension, which have independent effects on pregnancy outcomes,53, 54 we
performed separate analyses in which we controlled for maternal medical conditions –
diabetes (pre-existing or gestational), hypertension (pre-existing or gestational), and thyroid
conditions. Given that the relation between prepregnancy BMI and preterm birth may be
modified by gestational weight gain31, 36–38 and parity,22, 23, 33 we assessed effect
modification (statistical interaction) by average gestational weight gain per week in the 2nd
and 3rd trimesters (<0.5, 0.5–1.4, ≥1.5) and parity (parous vs. nulliparous). Formal tests for
interaction were conducted using the likelihood ratio test comparing models with and
without cross-product terms between BMI and the effect modifier, all coded as polytomous
categorical variables. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1.

Prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with waist circumference, weight change since
age 18, smoking during pregnancy, parity, previous preterm birth, and maternal medical
conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid conditions) and inversely associated with
gestational weight gain and educational attainment (Table 1). In addition to being associated
with BMI, prepregnancy waist circumference was positively associated with smoking during
pregnancy, being parous, being married or living as married, previous preterm birth, and
maternal medical conditions, and inversely associated with educational attainment and
gestational weight gain.

Data on the association of selected anthropometric factors with risk of SPTB and MPTB are
shown in Table 2. Women with BMI <18 had more than 2-fold increased risk of SPTB
relative to women with BMI 20–24 after adjustment for all risk factors including waist
circumference (OR=2.72, 95%CI=1.43–5.17). Prepregnancy obesity was not associated with
SPTB after adjustment for waist circumference (OR=1.15, 95%CI=0.75–1.77 for BMI ≥40).
Both low and high BMI categories were associated with an increased risk of MPTB after
adjustment for waist circumference: ORs for BMI <18 and ≥40 were 2.91 (95%CI=1.38–

6.14) and 1.73 (95%CI=1.11, 2.71), respectively. In additional analyses (data not shown),
adjustment for maternal medical conditions weakened the association between high BMI
and MPTB (ORs for BMI 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, and ≥40 relative to 20–24 were: 1.01,
95%CI=0.78–1.30; 1.77, 95%CI=1.31–2.40; 1.35, 95%CI=0.88–2.06; and 1.12,
95%CI=0.70–1.78) but strengthened the association between low BMI and MPTB (BMI
<18 relative to 20–24: OR=4.08, 95%CI=1.94–8.58).

We observed a positive association between waist circumference and SPTB that remained
after adjustment for BMI (≥35 vs. <27 inches: OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.91–2.06), but there was
little evidence of a dose-response relation. A positive association between waist
circumference and MPTB (≥35 vs. <27 inches: OR=1.88, 95%CI=1.36–2.60) attenuated
after adjustment for BMI (OR=1.30, 95%CI=0.87–1.95).

Weight gain of ≥30 kg since age 18 was positively associated with SPTB relative to weight
gain of 0–9 kg (OR=1.58, 95%CI=1.18–2.12), but there was no dose-response relation
(Table 2). Weight gain since age 18 was also positively associated with MPTB: ORs
comparing 10–19, 20–29, and ≥30 with 0–9 kg were 1.26 (95%CI=0.99–1.61), 1.71
(95%CI=1.30–2.24), and 2.18 (95%CI=1.59–2.99). Further control for waist circumference
did not alter the association of weight gain with MPTB, but attenuated that with SPTB (≥30
vs. 0–9 kg: OR=1.35, 95%CI=0.97–1.87).

Low and high gestational weight gain in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters were associated with an
increased risk of SPTB (Table 2). The multivariable ORs for SPTB were 1.51 among
women gaining <0.5 lbs/week during gestation (95%CI=1.17–1.97) and 1.42 for weight gain
≥1.5 lbs/week (95%CI=1.13–1.78) relative to a gain of 0.5–1.4 lbs/week. A similar pattern
was observed for MPTB. Results were virtually unchanged after adjustment for maternal
medical conditions.

Table 3 presents data on the association between anthropometric factors and risk of SPTB
according to gestational age at the infant's birth. Associations of low pregregnancy BMI,
high waist circumference, high weight gain since age 18, and low and high gestational
weight gain with SPTB risk were generally strongest in the <32 week gestation category. In
addition, obesity was associated with an increased risk of SPTB at <32 weeks gestation
(BMI ≥40 vs. 20–24: OR=2.54, 95%CI=1.03–6.25). The association between high BMI and
SPTB <32 weeks strengthened with further control for maternal medical conditions (data not
shown); relative to BMI 20–24, multivariable ORs for BMI 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, and ≥40
were: 1.08 (95%CI=0.64–1.84), 2.18 (95%CI=1.24–3.83), 2.49 (95%CI=1.08–5.77), and
3.20 (95%CI=1.27–8.06).

Associations between gestational weight gain and SPTB, within levels of prepregnancy BMI
and waist circumference, are shown in Table 4. Among normal weight women (BMI 20–
24), low gestational weight gain (<0.5 lbs/wk) was associated with a greater than two-fold
increased risk of SPTB (OR=2.62, 95%CI=1.62–4.26) relative to average weight gain (0.5–
1.4 lbs/week); in contrast, high gestational weight gain (≥1.5 lbs/week) was not associated
with an increased risk. Low gestational weight gain was also positively associated with
SPTB among obese women (OR=1.55, 95%CI=1.02–2.35). Among overweight and obese
women, high gestational weight gain (≥1.5 lbs/wk) was associated with an increased risk of
SPTB: ORs were 1.90 (95%CI=1.27–2.85) and 2.93 (95%CI=1.86–4.63), respectively. Low
gestational weight gain was associated with an increased risk of SPTB in both categories of
prepregnancy waist circumference. Among women with high waist circumference, a strong
positive association was observed between high gestational weight gain and SPTB risk
(OR=3.68, 95%CI=2.13–6.35).

No appreciable differences in association were found by parity status for any of the
anthropometric variables in relation to SPTB or MPTB (data not shown).

Discussion

We found a positive association between prepregnancy BMI <18 kg/m2 and both SPTB and
MPTB, but there were few women in that category of low BMI. Although high
prepregnancy BMI was not associated with SPTB overall, it was associated with very early
SPTB (<32 weeks). Most,19, 20, 22, 23, 36, 37 but not all32 studies, have reported a positive
association between maternal obesity and very early preterm birth (all subtypes combined);
two of these studies found a positive association among nulliparous women only.22, 23 In our
data, the association of prepregnancy obesity with early preterm birth was present in both
nulliparous and parous women. We observed a positive association between prepregnancy
BMI and MPTB overall, but it weakened appreciably after adjustment for maternal medical
conditions, suggesting the association is explained by conditions such as pre-gestational
hypertension or diabetes. In contrast, the results for very early SPTB (<32 weeks) did not
change with further adjustment for maternal medical conditions, suggesting a different
mechanism for an effect. While many previous studies have found a positive association of
obesity with MPTB,17, 21, 33, 38, 39 only one21 of five previous studies17, 21, 33, 38, 39 of SPTB
showed a positive association with obesity.21

Our data suggest a modest positive association of waist circumference with SPTB and
MPTB, but the results were not statistically significant and there was no evidence of a dose-
response relation. There are no previous studies on this topic with which to compare our
results. However, if the mechanism that explains this finding operates through insulin
resistance or hyperinsulinemia, then our findings are supported by a recent study of pregnant
women in which insulin levels were higher in pregnant women with upper-body (central)
obesity than in pregnant women with lower-body obesity or lean pregnant women, following
an oral glucose tolerance test.55

Adult weight gain was positively associated with risk of both SPTB and MPTB. To our
knowledge, there are no previous studies examining adult weight gain in relation to preterm
birth. Control for waist circumference attenuated the association between weight gain and
SPTB. To the extent that risk of preterm birth is associated with systemic inflammation,10–12
there is biologic support for an association between adult weight gain and preterm birth,
given the correlation between adult weight gain and systemic inflammation.40

In 1990, the Institute of Medicine published guidelines for gestational weight gain based on
a woman's prepregnancy BMI.45 Women with prepregnancy BMI <19.8 were advised to
gain 28–40 lbs (average: 0.7–1.0 lbs/week), those with BMI 19.8–26.0 were advised to gain
25–35 lbs (average: 0.6–0.9 lbs/week), and those with BMI 26.1–29.0 were advised to gain
15–25 lbs (0.4–0.6 lbs/week). A lower bound of 15 lbs (average ≥0.4 lbs/week) was
recommended for women with BMI >29.0. It was also recommended that Black women gain
at the upper end of the recommended ranges. These race-specific recommendations have
been questioned because there is limited evidence that they reduce risk of small-for-
gestational age births and some evidence that they increase risk of large-for-gestational age
births.46, 56 In the present study, low and high gestational weight gain were associated with
increased risks of both preterm birth subtypes, which is consistent with the literature.23 Low
gestational weight gain was associated with an increased risk of SPTB among normal weight
women and obese women. In addition, overweight or obese women with high weight gain
during pregnancy had an increased risk of SPTB. These results are generally consistent with
other studies that have shown low or average weight gain among obese women to be

associated with reduced risk of preterm birth.36–38, 57 Therefore, our results suggest that
weight gain recommendations should also incorporate an upper bound for obese women.

In our study, data on anthropometric variables and covariates were recorded before the index
pregnancy, thereby avoiding differential exposure misclassification (e.g., recall bias). The
ideal time to measure baseline BMI of a pregnant woman is before she has started gaining
weight due to gestation. Because true prepregnancy BMI is seldom available in registries or
hospital databases, which represent the largest sources of data from studies to
date,20, 23, 32, 36 researchers often use BMI in early pregnancy. However, by the time a
woman is seen for her first prenatal visit, she may have gained (or lost) several pounds
compared with her true prepregnancy weight.22 While self-reported BMI and adult weight
gain are subject to error, we observed high agreement between self-reported and technician-
measured weight.58 Moreover, we observed reasonable agreement between self-reported and
registry-supplied gestational weight gain.

We collected data on a wide range of potential confounders not routinely collected in large
registries, including whether the participant herself was born preterm and whether she had a
previous preterm birth, which allowed for better control of potential confounding variables.
The large sample size of the present study permitted an informative assessment of risk
factors in the overall dataset. Because there were small numbers in some categories when we
stratified by gestational age and BMI, caution is needed when interpreting those results.
Cohort retention was satisfactorily high, enough to reduce the influence of selection bias.
We have assessed the potential for bias due to selective losses by comparing baseline
characteristics of respondents and non-respondents and have found them to be similar in
important characteristics, such as BMI and parity.

We were able to analyze preterm birth subtypes separately, which can clarify the etiologic
role of the factors under study. However, preterm birth was self-reported and not based on
clinical assessment. Moreover, it is unclear whether the self-reported gestational age
information was based on ultrasound or LMP methods. It is reassuring that the BWHS
validation study indicated good accuracy of self-reported preterm birth and the overall
prevalence of preterm birth was comparable to the prevalence based on national data.48

The BWHS is a convenience sample of U.S. Black women. Because women must be literate
to participate in a study that collects data by mailed questionnaires, most BWHS participants
have completed high school or a higher level of education.47 Given that about 85% of Black
women of the same ages nationally have graduated high school,59 the BWHS results should
be generalizable to a large segment of the U.S. Black population.

The elucidation of risk factors for preterm birth is of great public health importance given its
increasing prevalence in the U.S. and its strong influence on infant morbidity and mortality.
The relation of obesity to preterm birth is especially relevant to African-American women
because they are disproportionately affected by both conditions. Our data suggest that both
overall and central adiposity, adult weight gain, and gestational weight gain influence the
risk of preterm birth among African-American women. If our results are replicated in future
studies, they offer the potential to improve birth outcomes through management of obesity
and gestational weight gain.
